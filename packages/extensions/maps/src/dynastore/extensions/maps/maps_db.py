    Fetches geometries and attributes for rendering, with full filter capabilities.

    Optimizations:
    1. Decouples Input BBOX CRS (bbox_srid) from Output Map CRS.
    2. Calculates dynamic simplification tolerance based on request width/height.
    3. Performs simplification in PostGIS to reduce I/O and memory usage.

    Multi-collection (UNION) requests must be **schema-homogeneous**: every
    collection in `collections` must expose the same column set and resolve to
    the same source SRID. The single `where_clause` and `source_srid` derived
    from `collections[0]` are applied to every UNION arm; diverging collections
    would silently produce wrong tiles (a column referenced in `subset_params`
    that exists only in collection[0] would explode on the next arm, and a
    spatial filter against the wrong storage CRS would return empty results).
    The heterogeneity check below raises ``ValueError`` (mapped to HTTP 400 by
    the caller) so the failure mode is explicit instead of silent. Refs #737.
