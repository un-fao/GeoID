# Eager imports so the package's `__init__` (loaded whenever the
# `dynastore.extensions:stac` entry point is resolved) populates both
# sidecar registries before any worker accepts traffic. Without this,
# `_coerce_pg_sidecar` can fail with
# `sidecar_type 'stac_metadata' not registered` on a worker whose
# request path hasn't yet pulled `stac_items_sidecar` lazily.
