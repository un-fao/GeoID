"""Pure declarations of catalog_status extension authorization policies.

The IAM module's ``PolicyContributor`` consumer reads these declarations
through the preset registered in ``presets/__init__.py`` and forwards them
to ``PermissionProtocol``.  This file never calls ``register_policy``
directly.

Two concerns:

``catalog_status_read``
    ALLOW ``GET`` on catalog/collection status views, gated by the
    ``catalog_membership_required`` condition. The status payload exposes
    operational detail (internal ``physical_schema`` name, provision task
    ``error_message``), so it is restricted to callers with a stake in the
    catalog: any principal holding a grant on the catalog (a member, not
    only catalog-admins), plus sysadmin / platform principals via the
    handler's built-in bypasses. The condition fails closed for anonymous
    requests (``principal_obj is None`` -> deny), so unauthenticated callers
    get nothing even though the policy is bound to the universal base role.
    The 404-on-hidden enforcement in the route handler is the second layer
    (a member of catalog A cannot probe catalog B's status).

``catalog_status_admin``
    ALLOW mutations (reprovision, dead-letter list/requeue) for
    catalog-admin-tier and above, gated by the ``catalog_admin_required``
    condition.  Policy id and shape mirror ``admin_catalog_access``.

    ``catalog_status_read`` is bound to the universal base role
    (``IamRolesConfig().anonymous_role_name`` — ``"unauthenticated"`` by
    default, which every request carries directly or via the role hierarchy).
    The binding only makes the policy *reachable*; the
    ``catalog_membership_required`` condition is what actually grants access,
    so the effective audience is "catalog members + sysadmin/platform" and
    anonymous requests are denied (the handler returns deny when there is no
    principal). Binding to the base role rather than to ``admin`` is
    deliberate: a non-admin member with a catalog grant must still be able to
    read status (the maintainer's "not just admins" requirement), and only the
    base role is guaranteed to be in every member's effective set.

    ``catalog_status_admin`` is bound to sysadmin + admin so both privileged
    tiers reach the mutation routes; the ``catalog_admin_required`` condition
    then scopes them to the catalogs they administer (mirrors how
    ``admin_catalog_access`` is wired in the admin extension).
