# --- Priority bands for geoid anonymous-access policies ---
#
# The IAM engine (PolicyService.evaluate_access) uses highest-priority-wins
# with DENY-on-tie at equal priority (#915). These constants establish a
# deterministic composition order so the geoid posture remains correct when
# an operator layers a generic catch-all DENY at the default priority (0) onto
# the unauthenticated role (e.g. a "deny everything not explicitly permitted"
# backstop).
#
# Band assignment:
#   _PRIORITY_ENUM_DENY  = 100 — block STAC/Features browse/list/search while
#       in lookup-only mode. Sits above a generic operator catch-all (0) so
#       these DENYs take effect even when the catch-all is absent.
#
#   _PRIORITY_LOOKUP_ALLOW = 200 — needle-lookup ALLOW on
#       POST /search/catalogs/{cat}/items-search. Must outrank a generic
#       deny-all at priority 0: if ALLOW and that catch-all DENY tied at 0,
#       DENY would win by tie-breaking, silently blocking the public lookup
#       surface. Priority 200 ensures the lookup ALLOW is always the decisive
#       policy for its own path (the enumeration DENYs do NOT cover
#       /search/…/items-search, so they do not compete here).
#
#   _PRIORITY_ANON_CREATE = 500 — per-collection anonymous item POST on
#       .../collections/{col}/items. The enumeration DENYs (_PRIORITY_ENUM_DENY)
#       cover that same item-POST path (they match GET/POST/…/items). This
#       ALLOW must outrank them so an opted-in collection's item-POST wins while
#       every browse/list/search verb stays denied by the DENYs.
_PRIORITY_ENUM_DENY = 100
_PRIORITY_LOOKUP_ALLOW = 200
#
#   _PRIORITY_ADMIN = 400 — ALLOW for the catalog admin role. Must outrank
#       the enumeration DENYs at 100 so a catalog admin can read and write
#       via Features and STAC regardless of the lookup-only posture. Sits
#       below _PRIORITY_ANON_CREATE (500) which is for a different role and
#       path set, so there is no interference.

# the DENY policies match only *needle* requests — a broadening enumeration
# request would then skip the DENY entirely and fall through, inverting the

# The route handler also validates the body; enforcing it declaratively here is
# defence-in-depth, so a future route refactor cannot silently turn the public
# lookup surface into an enumeration surface (un-fao/GeoID#1204 P2-R7). Order
