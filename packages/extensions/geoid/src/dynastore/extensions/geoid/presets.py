"""``geoid`` routing preset (#847) — flagship FAO GeoID profile.

Composes the ``private_catalog`` bundle (PG-first storage, per-tenant
private ES indexers on the items tier, IAM DENY on the catalog's routes)
and opts the catalog in to a single anonymous audience:

  * ``CatalogLookupAudience.is_public=True`` — opens the anonymous
    lookup-only needle endpoint ``POST /search/catalogs/{cat}/geoid-search``
    (resolve one item by exact ``geoid`` / ``external_id``, gated by the
    ``lookup_only_search`` handler so a broadening request never matches),
    and arms the geoid extension's anonymous STAC/Features enumeration DENY
    so the catalog is reachable only by exact lookup — never by browsing,
    listing, or filterable search.

``on_applied`` installs the per-catalog IAM policies in the catalog's
tenant schema (see ``catalog_policies.register_geoid_policies_for_catalog``):
the lookup ALLOW, the STAC + Features enumeration DENYs, and a dormant
per-collection anonymous-create ALLOW.

The bundle also carries a catalog-tier ``ItemsWritePolicy`` (see
``_build_registry_write_policy``) so the catalog's collections inherit
GeoID **registry** write semantics: geometry is the identity. An identical
geometry returns the geoid it is already registered under; a duplicate id is
refused (409); input is reprojected to 4326; any geometry type is accepted;
invalid geometry is rejected with a reason rather than silently repaired; and
geohash + S2 spatial cells plus geometry statistics are materialised for
lookup.

Anonymous *writes* are off by default: the catalog refuses anonymous inserts
(un-fao/GeoID#1204 — public users must not insert by default). A catalog admin
can enable anonymous inserts on specific collections by setting
``CollectionWriteAudience.allow_anonymous_create=True`` on them (PUT
``/configs/catalogs/{cat}/collections/{col}/plugins/collection_write_audience``).
For those collections, anonymous ``POST .../items`` is allowed: the
create ALLOW carries a higher priority than the enumeration DENY, so it wins
the #915 ranking (highest priority wins; DENY only wins on a tie) — while
every browse / list / search verb stays denied because the ALLOW is
POST-only. The two halves compose on one catalog: contribute an item and
resolve it later by a known ``geoid``, but never enumerate what is there.

    """Registry write semantics for a GeoID catalog's collections.

    Geometry is the registry's identity. The ``identity`` chain is evaluated
    top-down, first match wins:

      1. ``geometry_hash`` → ``REFUSE_RETURN`` — an incoming feature whose
         byte-exact geometry (SHA256 of ``ST_AsBinary(geom)``, taken after
         the 4326 reproject) already exists short-circuits the write and
         echoes the stored record, so the caller gets back the geoid the
         shape is already registered under. Idempotent: re-submitting the
         same shape — even under a different id — never mints a second geoid.
      2. ``external_id`` → ``REFUSE_FAIL`` — a *new* geometry submitted under
         an id that is already a geoid raises ``ConflictError`` (HTTP 409):
         a geoid is never registered twice.

    This deliberately inverts the platform default (external_id first): for a
    registry, collapsing identical geometries to one geoid regardless of the
    submitted id is the whole point.

    Geometry handling: every input is reprojected to EPSG:4326 (the geometries
    sidecar's default ``target_srid`` + the default TRANSFORM policy); any
    geometry type is accepted (``allowed_geometry_types=[]``); invalid geometry
    is REJECTed rather than silently repaired — the rejection message names the
    defect (``explain_validity``).

    ``content_hashes=["geometry"]`` arms the ``geometry_hash`` derivation the
    first rule references. ``spatial_cells`` materialise indexed geohash + S2
    keys for spatial lookup; ``geometry_stats`` precompute area / perimeter /
    centroid / bbox / vertex-count into a shared JSONB stats column (no
    per-stat column, no attribute index — the registry is queried by geoid and
    geohash, never by attribute).

    Set at the CATALOG tier by the preset; collections created later inherit
    it through the config waterfall unless they carry their own policy.
