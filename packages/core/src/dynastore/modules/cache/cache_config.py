"""
Cache module configuration (probe timeout, circuit breaker, oracle timeout).

Registered via PluginConfig framework so settings are:
- Runtime-configurable (no redeploy needed)
- Per-catalog overridable
- Accessible via /configs?plugin_id=cache_plugin_config API

**Migration note (operators):** Connection params (socket timeouts, TCP keepalives,
TLS, IAM, cluster settings) have moved to ``ValkeyEngineConfig`` at
``("platform", "protocols", "storage")``. The engine config supports live reconnect on change
without process restart. This config only holds cache-layer settings that don't
control the underlying connection.
