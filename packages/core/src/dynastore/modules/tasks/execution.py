"""
OGC-aligned job lifecycle engine.

Consolidates task lifecycle logic previously duplicated across runners
(SyncRunner, BackgroundRunner, FastAPIBackgroundRunner) and callers
(processes_module, dispatcher).  Runner selection is governed by the
platform-tier TaskRoutingConfig.

Execution paths:
  - Immediate (OGC Part 1):  execute()  → accepted → running → successful/failed
  - Deferred  (OGC Part 4):  create_job() → created; start_job() → accepted → ...
  - Dispatcher (queue):      dispatch()  → running → successful/failed
  - Dismiss   (OGC Part 1):  dismiss_job() → dismissed

OGC Job State Machine::

    POST .../jobs            → CREATED (unlocked)
      ├── PATCH .../jobs/{id}  → CREATED (updated)
      └── POST .../jobs/{id}/results → PENDING → ACTIVE → COMPLETED/FAILED

    POST .../execution       → PENDING → ACTIVE → COMPLETED/FAILED

    DELETE .../jobs/{id}     → DISMISSED (from any non-terminal state)
