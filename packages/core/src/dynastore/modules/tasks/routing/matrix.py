"""Pure builder for the default task routing matrix.

Shared by ``TaskRoutingConfig._materialize_if_empty`` and the deployment
presets.  Profile-independent per-entry data lives here; only the runner
type and hint set differ between cloud and onprem profiles.

Two flavours:

* ``cloud``  — processes run as GCP Cloud Run Jobs (``gcp_cloud_run``
  runner) unless they are lightweight; lightweight processes and all
  system tasks stay in-process (``background``).
* ``onprem`` — every task and process runs in-process (``background``
  runner, never Cloud Run), routed to its natural affinity tier
  (``CLOUD_PROCESS_CONSUMERS``: ``gdal`` -> catalog/maps, ``tiles_*`` ->
  maps, the rest -> catalog). Suits a worker-less deployment with no Cloud
  Run Jobs offload target.

    """Build the (tasks_map, processes_map) routing matrices for ``preset``.

    Args:
        inventory: Iterable of ``InventoryItem`` from the task registry.
        preset:    ``"cloud"`` (default), ``"onprem"``, or ``"review"``.

    Returns:
        A 2-tuple ``(tasks_map, processes_map)`` where each map is
        ``{task_key: [RunnerTarget, ...]}`` in application order.

    Selection semantics (per preset)
    ---------------------------------

    **System tasks** (``kind == "task"``), all presets:
        A single ``background`` entry whose ``consumers`` list contains the
        task's ``affinity_tier`` (falls back to ``"catalog"`` for
        tier-agnostic tasks).

    **Processes** (``kind == "process"``), cloud preset:
        Lightweight processes (``key in LIGHTWEIGHT_PROCESSES``) stay in-
        process: ``background`` runner, ``consumers=["catalog"]``,
        ``hints={BACKGROUND}``.
        All other processes offload to GCP Cloud Run Jobs: ``gcp_cloud_run``
        runner, ``consumers`` from ``CLOUD_PROCESS_CONSUMERS`` (defaulting
        to ``["catalog"]``), ``hints={OFFLOAD, HEAVY}``.  The ``options``
        dict is intentionally empty — job-name discovery is the runner's
        responsibility.

    **Processes** (``kind == "process"``), onprem preset:
        Every process runs in-process: ``background`` runner,
        ``hints={BACKGROUND}``, consumers taken from
        ``CLOUD_PROCESS_CONSUMERS`` (``gdal`` -> ``["catalog", "maps"]``,
        ``tiles_preseed``/``tiles_export`` -> ``["maps"]``, everything else
        -> ``["catalog"]``).  No process is routed to ``gcp_cloud_run`` and
        none is pinned to a dedicated ``"worker"`` tier — suits a worker-less
        deployment (a single fat node plus maps) with no Cloud Run Jobs.

    **Processes** (``kind == "process"``), review preset:
        Mirrors the cloud preset for every process EXCEPT ``gdal``, which
        runs as an in-process async background task on the catalog pod:
        ``background`` runner, ``consumers=["catalog"]``,
        ``hints={BACKGROUND, INTERACTIVE}``.  All other processes keep the
        same cloud target (``gcp_cloud_run`` + ``{OFFLOAD, HEAVY}``).
        Intended for review and local images only; production images use the
        cloud preset unchanged.
