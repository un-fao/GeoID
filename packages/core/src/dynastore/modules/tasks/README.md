# Tasks Module

Background job queue for DynaStore. Tasks are stored in one global PG table
(`{DYNASTORE_TASK_SCHEMA}.tasks`, default `tasks.tasks`) RANGE-partitioned by
`timestamp` (monthly). Multi-tenancy is modelled via columns, not per-tenant tables.

## Architecture

```
tasks.tasks  PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp)
  ├─ schema_name   VARCHAR   tenant discriminator (PG schema slug)
  ├─ task_id       UUID      row identifier
  ├─ scope         VARCHAR   CATALOG | SYSTEM | ASSET
  ├─ caller_id     VARCHAR   originator (user id or "system:platform")
  ├─ task_type     VARCHAR   registered runner key
  ├─ dedup_key     VARCHAR   optional; per-tenant uniqueness in non-terminal rows
  └─ ...
```

A single global dispatcher claims tasks across all tenants via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
Runners receive the `schema_name` so they can operate in the correct tenant context.

## Key Components

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tasks_module.py` | `TasksModule` (priority=15), DDL, CRUD (`enqueue`, `get_task`, `update_task`, `list_tasks`, `claim_batch`) |
| `dispatcher.py` | Global dispatcher; claim loop → runner dispatch |
| `queue.py` | `TaskQueue`; pg_notify LISTEN with polling fallback |
| `execution.py` | `ExecutionEngine`; routes tasks to registered runners, resolves terminal Actions (`on_success`/`on_failure`/`on_timeout`) |
| `runners.py` | `BaseTaskRunner` base + `BackgroundRunner` (in-process async); `CapabilityMap` claim gate |
| `routing/` | `TaskRoutingConfig`, `RunnerTarget`, `ExecHint`; the cloud/onprem/review matrix + presets; `resolved_targets` / `select_target` |
| `registry/` | Durable task-capability registry (what each deployed service can run) + `reconcile_routing_capabilities` starvation check |
| `models.py` | `Task`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate` Pydantic models |
| `tasks_config.py` | `TasksPluginConfig` (poll interval, dispatcher batch size, task timeout, ...) |

## Task Routing

Which service claims a task, and how it runs, is governed by `TaskRoutingConfig`
(a platform-tier `PluginConfig`, `class_key = task_routing_config`, address
`("platform", "tasks")`) — not by env vars or hard-coded rules. It holds two
ordered candidate maps:

```
tasks:     { task_key: [RunnerTarget, ...] }   # system tasks (cascade_cleanup, requeue_dead_letter_tasks, ...)
processes: { task_key: [RunnerTarget, ...] }   # OGC / user processes (gdal, dwh_join, tiles_export, ...)
```

`resolved_targets(task_key)` consults the `tasks` bucket first, then `processes`,
returning the ordered candidate list. When **both** maps are empty the
`_materialize_if_empty` validator builds the full cloud matrix from the live task
registry, so an empty seed still yields a complete, consumer-bearing config
(visible at `GET /configs/?resolved=true`).

### RunnerTarget

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `consumers` | Service tiers allowed to claim it (`["catalog"]`, `["maps"]`, `["worker"]`, ...). Empty ⇒ any capable service. |
| `runner` | `background` (in-process async) or `gcp_cloud_run` (delegated Cloud Run Job). |
| `options` | Per-target knobs, e.g. `{"timeout_seconds": 3600}`. |
| `hints` | `ExecHint` set: `INTERACTIVE`, `SYNC`, `BACKGROUND`, `OFFLOAD`, `HEAVY`. |
| `on_success` / `on_failure` / `on_timeout` | Terminal `Action` per outcome. |

An `Action` is `{action: ActionVerb, process?, hints, payload}` where
`ActionVerb ∈ {ROUTE, REPORT, DEAD_LETTER, FAIL}` (`ROUTE` requires a `process` —
a follow-on task to enqueue). Defaults: `on_success = REPORT`,
`on_failure = DEAD_LETTER`, `on_timeout = DEAD_LETTER`. `on_timeout` is distinct
from `on_failure`, so a timed-out offload can be re-routed without being treated
as a logic error.

### Deployment profiles (presets)

`build_routing_matrix` materializes three profiles; every target it emits carries
a non-empty `consumers` list — the structural guard against a task with no
claimer:

- **cloud** — processes offload to GCP Cloud Run Jobs (`gcp_cloud_run`, hints
  `{OFFLOAD, HEAVY}`) unless lightweight; system tasks and lightweight processes
  stay in-process (`background`).
- **onprem** — every task/process runs as a `background` worker on the `worker`
  tier; heavy processes get the `HEAVY` hint for a dedicated worker pool.
- **review** — mirrors cloud, except `gdal` runs in-process on the catalog pod
  (`background`, `["catalog"]`, hints `{BACKGROUND, INTERACTIVE}`) for review/local
  images; the production catalog image is unchanged.

Apply a profile from the admin presets UI (platform scope) or the `/admin/presets`
API — **dry-run → apply → rollback**. The presets register as
`CloudTaskRoutingPreset` / `OnpremTaskRoutingPreset` / `ReviewTaskRoutingPreset`
at `PresetTier.PLATFORM`.

### Discovery & diagnostics

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /configs/tasks/catalogue` | The task/process registry (kind-split). |
| `GET /configs/tasks/runners` | Runners registered on this service. |
| `GET /configs/tasks/capabilities` | Reconcile report; a non-empty `starving` list is a routed-but-unclaimable gap. |

### Runbook: a task never executes

If an enqueued task sits unclaimed it is **starving** — routed to a runner or
service that is not registered/deployed here. Diagnose:

1. `GET /configs/tasks/capabilities` — a `starving` entry names the task and the
   runner(s) it was routed to; the same condition is logged at WARNING
   (`... will STARVE ...`) by the startup reconcile.
2. Pick the fix:
   - **Routing typo / wrong tier** → edit the target's `consumers` / `runner` in
     `TaskRoutingConfig` (configs API) or re-apply a preset.
   - **Missing deployment** → deploy the runner the process is routed to (e.g. the
     `gcp_cloud_run` Cloud Run Job).

This is the failure mode behind the historical silent-starvation bug: it is now
loud (a WARN plus the `starving` report) instead of an indefinitely PENDING row.

## Tenant Isolation

- All CRUD operations (`get_task`, `update_task`) filter on **both** `task_id` and
  `schema_name`. A task_id alone is not tenant-safe.
- The dedup unique index `idx_tasks_dedup` is keyed on `(schema_name, dedup_key, timestamp)`.
  Two tenants sharing the same `dedup_key` do not collide.
- The cross-partition dedup guard in `enqueue()` is also scoped by `schema_name`.

## Initialization

On startup `TasksModule` (priority=15, before `CatalogModule` at 20):

1. Acquires an advisory lock for the duration of all DDL — prevents concurrent-revision
   races on Cloud Run rolling deploys.
2. Creates the `tasks` table, indexes, and pg_notify triggers if absent.
3. Ensures 12 monthly future partitions exist and registers retention cron jobs.
4. Asserts the current-month partition is present before starting the dispatcher.

## Task Attribution

Every task carries a `caller_id`:
- **User tasks** — the authenticated user's identifier.
- **System tasks** — `system:platform` (set by `ApiKeyModule`).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DYNASTORE_TASK_SCHEMA` | `tasks` | Schema that holds the global tasks table |
| `DYNASTORE_QUEUE_POLL_INTERVAL` | `30.0` | Fallback poll interval in seconds |
