"""Capability liveness oracle backed by the shared cache.

Answers the question "does any live worker pod advertise capability X?"
by checking a sentinel key in the shared :class:`CacheBackend`. The
publisher side (:mod:`capability_publisher`) refreshes the same key on
each heartbeat tick; when the last pod with the capability dies the TTL
expires and :meth:`is_capability_live` flips to ``False``.

Used by the dispatcher's reactive reaper (see ``dispatcher.py``): when
``TaskProtocol.can_claim`` rejects a row, the dispatcher consults this
oracle. If no pod is alive with the required capability, the row is
moved to ``DEAD_LETTER`` with a clear ``error_message`` instead of being
left PENDING forever.

Fail-safe by design: any error (no backend registered, network blip,
cache outage) is swallowed and the oracle returns ``True`` — preferring
"leave PENDING + WARN" over a false DLQ.
