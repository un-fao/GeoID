"""Engine snapshot resolver — sync ``engine_ref → EngineConfig`` lookup.

:class:`~dynastore.modules.db_config.engine_instance_cache.EngineInstanceCache`
takes a synchronous ``engine_resolver`` callable.
:class:`~dynastore.modules.db_config.platform_config_service.PlatformConfigService.get_config`
is async — so we build a *snapshot* of the platform-tier engine configs at
:meth:`DBConfigModule.lifespan` start and serve from that.

Snapshot semantics (Cycle F.6):

- Walks every concrete :class:`EngineConfig` subclass via
  :func:`~dynastore.modules.db_config.engine_registry.list_registered_engines`.
- Calls ``await pcfg.get_config(cls)`` once per kind; in the F.1
  single-instance-per-kind contract, that's all the engines that exist.
- Indexes the result both by ``class_key`` (e.g. ``postgresql_engine_config``)
  and by ``engine_class`` discriminator (e.g. ``postgresql_engine``) so
  default-deployment ref-naming conventions both resolve.
- F.4c will add per-scope ref-keyed storage (operator-chosen ref names like
  ``pg_main`` + ``pg_secondary``); this resolver is the seam where that
  widening happens.

Until F.4c lands no driver actually consumes the cache in production, but
the lifespan still constructs the cache so tests + admin tooling can
exercise the contract end-to-end.
