# DB connection / pool tunables resolve in the order:

# The file (loaded once at import) is the leak-proof deployment surface: a JSON
# *value* is never shell-substituted, so a missing key can never arrive as a
# literal ``${...}`` placeholder the way a templated env var can (#1581). An
# explicitly-set, valid env var still wins (dev / compose / deliberate
# override); the file fills the gap a deploy would otherwise template; the code
# default is the last resort. See ``instance.load_db_config``.

# Smallest persistent base (``pool_size``) a pool may hold. The review-env
# outage (dynastore #320) ran with ``DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE=2`` and timed out under
# concurrent load ("QueuePool limit of size 2 overflow 3 reached, connection
# timed out, timeout 60.00"). That failure was a *total-capacity* starvation —
# size 2 + overflow 3 = 5 connections could not serve the concurrency — NOT a
# shortage of persistent base connections. Concurrency is served by the total
# (``pool_size + max_overflow``), enforced by ``SAFE_POOL_TOTAL_FLOOR`` below;
# ``pool_size`` only controls how many connections stay warm between bursts.
#
# Because the base is held for the lifetime of every worker, ``pool_size ×
# GUNICORN_WORKERS × MIN_SCALE`` is the persistent connection footprint a
# deployment pins on the shared Postgres even at idle (dynastore #392). Forcing
# a large base onto light services (auth/tools) multiplied that idle footprint
# for no concurrency benefit. So we trust the operator's small ``pool_min_size``
# and floor it only at 1 — a pool needs at least one connection; everything
# above that is a deployment choice. Burst safety is the total floor's job.
SAFE_POOL_MIN_FLOOR: int = 1

# Smallest total pool capacity (``pool_size + max_overflow``) we consider safe
# under concurrent load. This is the real #320 invariant: regardless of how
# small the base is, an engine must be able to open this many connections at
# once or concurrent checkouts queue until they hit the QueuePool timeout. The
# dev auth/tools probe-timeout outage was the floor-collapse corner of this —
# base clamped to 5 against ``DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE=3`` left total 5 / overflow 0, a
# rigid pool that deadlocked startup consumers (engine-snapshot PG engine +
# event shards) needing more than the base at once. A total floor of 10 gives
# every pool real burst headroom; overflow connections are transient (opened on
# demand, returned to the pool), so the steady-state footprint stays the base.
SAFE_POOL_TOTAL_FLOOR: int = 10

# Smallest burst headroom (``max_overflow`` = max - base) we consider safe, so a
# pool whose base happens to sit near its max still keeps room to grow. Belt to
# the total floor's braces: ``SAFE_POOL_TOTAL_FLOOR`` guarantees the absolute
# ceiling, this guarantees the *gap* above whatever base the operator chose.
