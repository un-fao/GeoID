        The initial ``build_engine_snapshot`` call runs synchronously, but at
        this point in lifespan ``DBService`` (priority 10) has not yet
        installed the connection pool, so every per-engine fetch fails with
        ``Cannot start managed_transaction: db_resource is None.`` and the
        snapshot returns empty.  Without recovery, ``EngineInstanceCache.get``
        would then raise ``KeyError`` forever on this process.

        To bridge the boot-order gap we hand the same snapshot dict to a
        background retry task (``refresh_snapshot_until_ready``); the
        resolver closure observes the dict by reference, so as soon as
        ``DBService`` brings the pool up the retry populates entries and
        every later ``engine_cache.get`` call resolves them.  The task is
        cancelled on lifespan teardown.
