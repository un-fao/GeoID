"""Cascade cleanup owner for pending maintenance work.

:class:`MaintenancePendingOwner` cancels still-pending ``tasks.tasks`` rows
that belong to a catalog or collection being hard-deleted.  Completed /
terminal rows are immutable and age out via the monthly partition-drop GC —
they are not deleted per-tenant.

Only PENDING rows are touched.  ACTIVE rows may be mid-flight (including the
cascade_cleanup task that drives this very owner); they are left untouched so
the worker can complete or fail them naturally.

The tasks table lives in the ``tasks`` PG schema (``get_task_schema()``).
Rows are discriminated by the ``schema_name`` column, which is the tenant
physical schema (e.g. ``s_abc123``).  The cascade_cleanup task itself is
created with ``schema_name='system'`` and is therefore structurally excluded
by the tenant-schema filter — a defensive ``AND schema_name <> 'system'``
predicate reinforces this.

Event rows in ``tasks.events`` are reclaimed by the DROP-PARTITION retention
GC when their day partition is dropped; there is no per-row cancel needed.
The legacy ``events.events`` table has been removed.

``physical_schema`` is resolved at ``describe_scope`` time (inside the delete
transaction, while ``catalog.catalogs`` still has the row) and snapshotted
into :attr:`CleanupRef.metadata`.  ``cleanup_one`` reads it from the snapshot
so it does not need to re-query a row that may no longer exist.

Register via :func:`register_owners` from the catalog module lifespan BEFORE
the :class:`~dynastore.modules.catalog.cascade_registry.CascadeCleanupRegistry`
is frozen.
