Elasticsearch index mapping + naming for the envelope items driver.

Driver-private — not imported by the platform :mod:`modules.elasticsearch.mappings`,
which holds only platform-wide STAC mappings (catalog/collection/item/asset).

Stores the full feature (geometry + properties + identity) in a single index
per tenant (catalog), plus a canonical *access envelope* (``visibility`` /
``owner``) carried as typed root keyword fields. The
access fields are intentionally part of the STATIC mapping (root
``dynamic: false``) — never dynamically inferred — so that a row-level access
filter built from them is reliable: a field that is sometimes absent from the
mapping (because no document happened to populate it yet, or because a
mis-typed value was indexed dynamically) would make a ``terms`` filter
silently under- or mis-match, which for a security predicate is unacceptable.

Tenant attributes live under a ``properties`` sub-tree that stays
``dynamic: true`` so new attribute fields index without a mapping update.
