# Hard-import the async PG driver at module load.  When SCOPE excludes
# ``module_db`` (e.g. Cloud Run jobs that use ``db_sync`` + DatastoreModule
# only), asyncpg is genuinely not installed.  Without this import,
# ``create_async_engine(postgresql+asyncpg://…)`` blows up deep inside
# the SQLAlchemy lifespan with a ModuleNotFoundError that re-raises as
# ``CRITICAL: Foundational module 'DBService' failed during startup``.
# Failing here instead lets the module-discovery layer
# (modules/__init__.py) catch the ImportError on __init__, set
# ``instance=None``, and silently skip the lifespan — exactly the same
# wrong-SCOPE-soft-skip contract used by GCP/ES/dwh/export/gdal/ingestion
# tasks.  Same fix family as project_geoid_task_routing_config v0.5.86–89.

    asyncpg exposes no libpq client-side keepalive params, so the keepalive
    GUCs we pass via ``server_settings`` only make the *server* probe the
    *client*. They never arm ``SO_KEEPALIVE`` on the client socket, so a
    connection silently dropped by the VPC-egress path is discovered only when
    ``pool_pre_ping`` borrows the dead socket — and that probe then blocks up
    to ``connect_timeout`` (the seconds-long ``db_pool_acquire`` waits seen in
    review). Arming the client socket lets the kernel detect the dead peer in
    keepalive / ``TCP_USER_TIMEOUT`` time instead, and the periodic probes keep
    the egress mapping warm so idle connections stop dying in the first place.

    Reuses the same ``DBConfig.tcp_keepalives_*`` values as the server-side
    GUCs so one set of knobs governs both directions. Linux-only socket
    options are applied best-effort; options missing on the platform (e.g.
    macOS dev) and any error are swallowed so connection creation never fails.
