"""Canonical, policy-independent Elasticsearch _source builders.

The canonical-index-envelope initiative (#1800) shipped the item builder; the
generalization (#1285) factors its section assembly into a level-agnostic core
(:func:`build_canonical_envelope`) reused by every entity level (catalog /
collection / item / asset). The shape is the contract — ``system`` (core
identity/lifecycle), ``properties`` (attributes), ``stats`` (derived),
``access`` (IAM), plus reserved protocol-structural members the read-time
projector surfaces verbatim. ES-only for now; other drivers keep their own
internal storage concern.

    One modular, pluggable shape for every entity level. The sections are the
    contract; what fills them is the caller's (per-level) concern:

    * **flat identity** — ``identity`` keys sit at the document top level
      (``id``, ``catalog_id``, ``collection_id``, ``external_id``, ``asset_id``,
      ``validity``, the ``_external_id`` read tracker …). ``id`` is whatever
      stable identifier the level uses (``geoid`` for items, ``collection_id``
      for collections, ``catalog_id`` for catalogs).
    * **reserved members** — protocol-structural keys surfaced verbatim by the
      read-time projector (``collection``/``geometry``/``bbox`` for items;
      ``extent``/``summaries``/``providers``/``links``/``assets``/
      ``stac_extensions`` for collections; …). ``None`` values are skipped.
    * **properties** — the attribute bag. Reshaped through
      :func:`project_item_for_es` so unknown keys move under
      ``properties.extras`` (the ``flattened`` long-tail lane) and the analyzed
      ``_search_text`` catch-all is populated — identical handling at every
      level, so the strict ``dynamic: false`` mapping never grows per-key.
    * **metadata** — multilingual descriptive metadata (``title``,
      ``description``, ``keywords``), sourced from the ``ItemMetadataSidecar``
      (refs #1828). Typed ``dynamic: false`` mapping with per-language analyzed
      sub-fields. Emitted when non-empty.
    * **system** — the core identity/lifecycle container. Emitted when non-empty.
    * **stats** — derived values. Emitted when non-empty.
    * **access** — the IAM authorization sidecar, plugged in by the ABAC layer.
      Emitted when non-empty.

    Pure function — returns a new dict; inputs are not mutated. Reserved
    GeoJSON/STAC members never leak into ``properties`` (enforced by
    :func:`project_item_for_es`).
