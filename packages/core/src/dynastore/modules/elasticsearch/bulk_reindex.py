"""Driver-level bulk reindex helpers for Elasticsearch.

These functions implement the actual bulk-index orchestration against the
Elasticsearch driver. They live at the **module** level (not in a task
package) so that any consumer — task, extension, or external integration —
can import and call them directly without going through the dispatcher.

The module-level placement matches the pattern established for
:mod:`dynastore.modules.elasticsearch.client`,
:mod:`dynastore.modules.elasticsearch.mappings`, and the rest of the ES
driver: drivers belong to ``modules``, tasks orchestrate them.

Hard runtime dep on ``opensearchpy`` is satisfied transitively via the
client/mappings imports — no extra import gating needed here.

    """Stream every item of a collection from the routing-resolved source-of-truth
    reader and bulk-write it via the routing-resolved secondary-index writer.

    Resolution strategy:

    - **Reader**: when ``reader_ref`` is given it is resolved directly from the
      driver registry (used by file-backed collections to name the file driver
      explicitly). Otherwise it is resolved via
      :func:`~dynastore.modules.storage.router.get_items_search_driver` with
      ``hints={Hint.GEOMETRY_EXACT}`` — the source-of-truth store for this
      collection, which is PostgreSQL for a PG-primary collection and the file
      driver (DuckDB) for a file-backed one, since that driver also advertises
      ``GEOMETRY_EXACT``. Either way the ES read path is bypassed — we must not
      read from the index we are rebuilding.
    - **Writer**: resolved via :func:`~dynastore.modules.storage.router.get_write_drivers`,
      then filtered to the first secondary-index entry (``is_item_indexer=True``) that
      differs from the reader.  When ``driver_hint`` is supplied, that ``driver_ref``
      is used directly instead.

    The reader and writer MUST resolve to different drivers. If the resolved writer
    equals the reader this function raises ``ValueError`` immediately — a reindex that
    reads and writes to the same driver is a no-op at best and a data hazard at worst.

    Chunks are sized to ``max(page_size, writer.preferred_chunk_size)`` when the writer
    declares a preference; otherwise ``page_size`` governs.

    Write failures propagate: :class:`~dynastore.modules.storage.errors.EsBulkWriteError`
    (and any other exception from ``write_entities``) are re-raised after logging the
    failure count so the task can surface them and apply its ``on_failure`` policy.
    The returned count reflects only successfully written documents.

    Alias enrolment: the writer's index is enrolled in the public alias once before
    streaming begins (idempotent; best-effort).

    Args:
        catalog_id: Catalog owning the collection.
        collection_id: Collection to reindex.
        driver_hint: Optional ``driver_ref`` override that selects the WRITE target
            directly (e.g. ``"items_elasticsearch_driver"``). Takes precedence over
            the secondary-index auto-select.
        reader_ref: Optional ``driver_ref`` override that selects the READ source
            directly (e.g. ``"items_duckdb_driver"`` for a file-backed collection).
            Takes precedence over the GEOMETRY_EXACT hint resolution.
        page_size: Items per read page (and write chunk, unless the writer declares
            a larger ``preferred_chunk_size``).

    Returns:
        Number of documents successfully written to the target index.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If routing cannot resolve a valid reader/writer pair.
        RuntimeError: If required protocols are unavailable.
