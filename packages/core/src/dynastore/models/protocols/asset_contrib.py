"""
Generalized, consumer-agnostic asset-link contribution protocol.

Producers (Maps, Tiles, Features, …) implement `AssetContributor` and
declare what asset links they can emit for a given resource reference.
Consumers (STAC, Records, Coverages, Features) iterate
`get_protocols(AssetContributor)` and attach the yielded `AssetLink`s
to their own representation, without importing each other.

This is distinct from TRANSFORM-capable asset drivers (role-based driver
plan §Protocols), which mutate a single asset document at read time
e.g. resolve URIs, filter fields.  `AssetContributor` adds sibling links;
TRANSFORM rewrites the document.
