"""Stable advisory-lock ID derivations for PostgreSQL.

This module provides exactly two derivation functions.  Both are
intentionally distinct because they serve different PostgreSQL locking
primitives:

``stable_lock_id_sha256``
    Session-scoped leadership election via ``pg_advisory_lock`` /
    ``pg_try_advisory_lock``.  A session lock is held until the
    session ends (or the lock is explicitly released).  SHA-256 is
    used to produce a signed 64-bit integer from the first 8 bytes
    of the digest.

``stable_lock_id_blake2b``
    Transaction-scoped serialization guards via
    ``pg_try_advisory_xact_lock``.  A transaction lock is released
    automatically when the surrounding transaction commits or rolls
    back.  BLAKE2b with digest_size=8 is used and the result is
    masked to a non-negative 63-bit integer that fits PostgreSQL's
    signed ``bigint`` type.

**Both output spaces are FROZEN.**  Changing either derivation
re-keys advisory locks so that, during a rolling deploy, old and new
pods derive different integers for the same logical lock name.  When
two pods hold different session advisory locks they both believe they
are the sole leader — a split-brain double-drain scenario where two
processes independently drain the same queue simultaneously.  Update
either function only with a coordinated, flag-gated, zero-downtime
migration that ensures all pods move together.

    Uses SHA-256: takes the first 8 bytes of the digest and interprets
    them as a big-endian *signed* integer so the output can be negative.
    This matches the PostgreSQL ``bigint`` range ``[-2^63, 2^63-1]``.

def stable_lock_id_blake2b(*parts: str) -> int:
    """Stable non-negative 63-bit integer for ``pg_try_advisory_xact_lock``.

    Uses BLAKE2b with ``digest_size=8`` over the null-byte-joined UTF-8
    encoding of ``parts``.  The raw unsigned 64-bit value is masked to
    63 bits (``& 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF``) so the result is always
    non-negative and fits PostgreSQL's signed ``bigint``.

    Python's built-in ``hash()`` is salted per-process (PEP 456) unless
    ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` is fixed — two pods hashing the same string will
    produce different values, breaking any cross-pod serialization
    guarantee.  BLAKE2b is deterministic across pods, processes, and
    Python versions.

    Used for transaction-scoped serialization guards.  The output is
    FROZEN — see module docstring for the split-brain risk of any change.
