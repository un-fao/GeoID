"""``WorkEventDrainTask`` — control-plane-native drain for ``tasks.work_events``.

The event-plane counterpart of :class:`StorageDrainTask`.  Drains the GLOBAL
``tasks.work_events`` table for ALL tenants (tenancy is the ``schema_name``
column, not the physical table) and delivers each event to the in-process
async listeners registered on the resolved :class:`EventBusProtocol`.

Why a control-plane task and not the in-process shard loop
----------------------------------------------------------
The legacy event plane is drained in-process by ``EventService``'s 16
leader-elected shard loops (``events.events``).  The WorkClass end-state moves
delivery onto the generic task control plane so it shares routing, the
capability registry, heartbeat leasing, and the co-transactional NOTIFY wakeup
with every other durable task — and can be offloaded to a dedicated worker the
same way the index drain and gdal are.  Event *handlers* stay where they are:
this task resolves the process-local listener registry via
``get_protocol(EventBusProtocol)`` and calls
:meth:`EventBusProtocol.dispatch_to_listeners`, so no handler is rewritten or
relocated — the task simply runs in a worker scope that loads them.

Claim_version fencing (#1945)
-----------------------------
Every claim bumps ``claim_version = claim_version + 1`` on the row.  Terminal
writes (``mark_done`` / ``mark_retry``) are guarded by::

    AND owner_id = :owner_id AND claim_version = :claim_version

If a stalled drain worker reclaimed by another pod (bumping ``claim_version``
again) later tries to finalize the row, the CAS predicate matches 0 rows — the
stale write is a no-op and the live owner retains exclusive control.  This is
the same fence the index plane uses, expressed against the ``work_events``
column vocabulary (``owner_id`` / ``locked_until`` rather than ``claimed_by`` /
``claimed_at`` / ``ready_at``).

Lifecycle
---------
``work_events`` carries the legacy event lifecycle vocabulary
(``PENDING`` / ``PROCESSING`` / ``DEAD_LETTER``) plus a terminal ``COMPLETED``
state — unlike the legacy ``events.events`` table, drained rows are NOT deleted
on ack; whole-leaf ``DROP PARTITION`` retention reclaims them (the failure
forensics window the #1807 red-team note requires).  ``locked_until`` serves
double duty: the claim lease while ``PROCESSING`` and the retry-not-before
delay while ``PENDING``.

Drain loop
----------
``run(payload)`` loops ``drain_once()`` until it returns 0, then exits
(one-shot drain-to-empty, matching ``StorageDrainTask`` / ``OutboxDrainTask``).
The dispatcher re-enters via NOTIFY / periodic catch-up.
