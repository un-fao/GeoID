"""Unified input model for the public ``elasticsearch_indexer`` OGC Process.

A single shape that can drive either a catalog-wide reindex (when only
``catalog_id`` is set) or a single-collection reindex (when ``collection_id``
is also set). The dispatcher class :class:`.indexer_task.ElasticsearchIndexerTask`
adapts this to the legacy ``BulkCatalogReindexInputs`` / ``BulkCollectionReindexInputs``
expected by the underlying implementations.
