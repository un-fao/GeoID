"""Pyogrio-backed reader, registered as a fallback.

Sits strictly behind :class:`GdalOsgeoReader` (``priority=10``), which
binds the **system** libgdal via ``osgeo.ogr``.  This reader hard-imports
``pyogrio`` instead — pyogrio ships its own GDAL build in the PyPI wheel,
so it provides a vector-read path in scopes that pull in ``geospatial_io``
but not the ``module_gdal`` osgeo bindings.  ``priority=100`` keeps it a
tail candidate.
