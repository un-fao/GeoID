    items SEARCH driver, when one is configured and search-capable.

    Used by the OGC API - Features and OGC API - Records ``/items`` endpoints
    so they resolve the items SEARCH driver via routing
    (:func:`router.get_items_search_driver` — ``Operation.SEARCH`` then a
    ``READ`` fallback) and dispatch the structural query to **that driver**
    through its streaming ``read_entities`` + ``count_entities`` contract —
    exactly as STAC ``/search`` does. A public-ES catalog, a GEOID-style
    catalog routing SEARCH to its tenant-private ES index, or any future
    ES items driver are all served the same way, with no hardcoded driver
    class (#1047).

    Returns ``None`` (caller falls back to the existing PostgreSQL
    ``stream_items`` path) when the dispatch is not applicable:

    * a CQL2 / shorthand attribute ``filter`` is present (no CQL2→search-backend
      translator yet — same restriction as STAC ``/search``);
    * the resolved driver is a read-primary fallback (PostgreSQL, advertising
      ``Capability.QUERY_FALLBACK_SOURCE``) — i.e. the catalog has no dedicated
      search backend;
    * the resolved driver does not advertise the structural-search capability;
    * driver resolution or the dispatch itself raises (degrade, never 500).

    On a successful dispatch returns a :class:`QueryResponse` whose ``items`` is
    an async iterator of read-contract :class:`~dynastore.models.ogc.Feature`
    objects and whose ``total_count`` carries the backend ``numberMatched`` —
    so paging links stay correct (unlike the ``read_entities`` browse path,
    which cannot report a total).

    Row-level ABAC: when the resolved driver opts in (the standardized envelope
    driver, ``applies_access_filter=True``) and the Starlette ``request`` is
    supplied, the caller's read scope is compiled from request state via the
    shared :func:`compile_read_access_filter` and set on the dispatched
    ``QueryRequest`` — the same single piece of security logic the STAC
    ``/search`` fast path and the search extension use, so the enforcement paths
    cannot drift. The envelope driver fails closed when the filter is absent, so
    an un-wired caller can only under-return, never leak; a non-envelope driver
    ignores the field, so this is behaviour-neutral for existing catalogs.
