"""
Geometry simplification tool shared by Elasticsearch drivers.

Ensures a JSON-serialized document fits under a given byte budget
(Elasticsearch's per-doc limit is 10 MB). The geometry is simplified
iteratively with an adaptive tolerance chosen from the observed
size ratio; after `max_iterations` attempts the geometry is replaced
with its bounding box as a hard floor.

The caller receives a `simplification_factor` (final/original byte
ratio) and a `simplification_mode` so the persisted document can
record how much fidelity was lost.

Geometry policy (issue #1248)
=============================

Simplification is **opt-in**. Elasticsearch drivers index *exact*
geometry by default; they only call :func:`simplify_to_fit` when their
``simplify_geometry`` driver config flag is set (or an equivalent
routing hint asks for the simplified read surface). Use
:func:`maybe_simplify_for_es` so each write call site honours that flag
with a single line.

When simplification stays disabled, the platform must not silently
truncate an oversized geometry: the pre-write guard in
``item_service.upsert`` rejects an item whose geometry serializes above
:data:`DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES` with HTTP 422 *before* any driver write, so
the PG primary row is never created (ES is an async secondary; rejecting
post-commit would leave PG and ES inconsistent). The byte measurement
uses the GeoJSON serialization of the geometry alone (see
:func:`geometry_geojson_size`) because the ES per-document limit is
dominated by the geometry payload and the threshold is an ES constraint.
