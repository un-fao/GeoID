    Loads a ``.env`` file co-located with a component's source file (module,
    extension, or task) **without overriding** environment variables that are
    already set.

    Convention: place a ``.env`` file in the same directory as the file that
    contains the class implementing the plugin protocol (``ModuleProtocol``,
    ``ExtensionProtocol``, or ``TaskProtocol``).  The framework discovers and
    loads it automatically before the component is instantiated, so any secrets
    or local-dev overrides declared there are available from the very first line
    of ``__init__``.

    Existing environment variables always take precedence (``override=False``),
    so production/CI values set via Docker or CI secrets are never clobbered.
