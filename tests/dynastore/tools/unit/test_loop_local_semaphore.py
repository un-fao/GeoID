"""Unit tests for ``dynastore.tools.async_utils.LoopLocalSemaphore``.

Like the ``LoopLocalLock`` tests, these deliberately use ``asyncio.run(...)``
(a fresh event loop each call) because the whole point of
``LoopLocalSemaphore`` is correctness across *distinct* loops — the scenario a
raw module-level / singleton ``asyncio.Semaphore()`` fails.
