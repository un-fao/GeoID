"""Code-review guard: framework control points stay runner-agnostic.

`tools/async_utils.py`, `modules/concurrency.py`, and the cache modules are the
platform's concurrency/caching **control points**. They must not import a web
framework (FastAPI / Starlette): doing so couples the runner-agnostic core to a
specific serving stack and creates a cross-layer contamination that breaks reuse
from sync workers, task runners, and tests.

This pins the rule from the project memory
(`feedback_central_control_points_runner_agnostic`). Currently clean — the guard
keeps it that way.
