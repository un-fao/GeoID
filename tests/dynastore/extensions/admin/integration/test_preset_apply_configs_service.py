"""Real ``ConfigsService`` integration coverage for preset apply (#969).

The unit suite (``unit/test_admin_presets_endpoint.py``) mocks
``ConfigsProtocol.set_config``, so it proves the apply loop *calls*
``set_config`` with the right classes/scope but never exercises the
validate → persist → cascade-validator chain end to end. This module
fills that gap against a live ``ConfigsService`` + Postgres.

Two paths are pinned:

1. **Green path** — apply the ``public_catalog`` preset to a clean
   catalog and assert the three routing tiers were persisted at catalog
   scope through the real ``set_config`` lifecycle (read back the
   tier-local rows, not a waterfall-resolved view). This proves apply
   goes *through* ``set_config`` rather than around it.

2. **Reachable reject path** — the issue's original red-path recipe
   ("apply a preset that mixes catalog-private + items-public so the
   cascade rejects") is *unreachable* via preset apply: every shipped
   preset is internally consistent, and apply does not re-validate
   already-persisted child collection configs. The composition guard
   (``_assert_public_collection_has_public_parent``) is instead reached
   by writing a *public* collection routing config under a *private*
   (PG-only) parent catalog. That write must fail closed with HTTP 400
   and the guard's specific detail message — not 500, not a silent pass.

Both presets pin Elasticsearch driver refs on the public tiers, so the
ES drivers must be registered for the routing validators to accept them
(an unregistered WRITE driver is rejected outright by
``_validate_collection_routing_config``). The ``elasticsearch`` module
supplies those drivers plus the live client; the tests therefore run
only when a real Elasticsearch is available and are skipped otherwise —
the same opt-in contract the rest of the ES integration suite uses.
