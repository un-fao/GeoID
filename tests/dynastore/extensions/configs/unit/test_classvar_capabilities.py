"""Pin the post-#678 contract: ``capabilities`` is a ClassVar on every
driver config, not a Pydantic field.

Plan #6 of umbrella #665 said capabilities are a structural property of
the driver class — they cannot vary at runtime, so they must NOT appear
in the composed-config wire payload. The legitimate operator-facing
surface is the registry endpoint (``describedby`` → ``GET
/configs/registry/{class_key}``), reached via the ``DriverInfo`` DTO at
``service.py:list_drivers()``.

These tests fix that contract:

  1. ``capabilities`` is absent from ``model_fields`` on every concrete
     driver config (so Pydantic skips it in ``model_dump()`` and the
     generated JSON Schema).
  2. ClassVar lookup via an instance still returns the per-class set
     (so the ~25 runtime consumers reading ``obj.capabilities`` are
     unaffected).
  3. ``model_dump()`` of a freshly-constructed instance carries no
     ``capabilities`` key.
  4. The generated JSON Schema does not declare a ``capabilities``
     property.
