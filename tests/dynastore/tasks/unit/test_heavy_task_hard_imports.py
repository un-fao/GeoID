"""Static-lint regression: every heavy task module MUST top-level-import
its hardest runtime dep.

Without this gate, removing ``@requires(Protocol)`` (geoid v0.5.86) means a
service whose SCOPE doesn't pull in the runtime dep would still load the task
class via the entry-point loader → CapabilityMap surfaces it → claim → runtime
crash. Hard imports cause the entry-point load to fail loud, so the task is
excluded from the dispatcher's claimable types instead.

Symmetric with the elasticsearch hard-import fix (54d1cdc) and the GCP fix
(3da0f10).
