"""Regression test for the ``DefinitionOnlyTask`` placeholder closure bug.

Background: ``register_task_definitions_only`` creates a ``DefinitionOnlyTask``
*inside* the ``for ep in entry_points(...)`` loop. The class previously held a
``@staticmethod get_definition`` that returned the bare loop variable
``process_def`` — a free-variable closure that resolves at call time, not at
class-definition time. Every placeholder therefore returned the **last**
``process_def`` produced by the loop, not its own.

The bug was dormant in practice because the dispatcher reads the captured
``TaskConfig.definition`` field (set correctly at registration time) and
never calls ``task_config.cls.get_definition()`` post-registration. Still
incorrect on its face — a future refactor that called the class method
would silently get the wrong definition for every placeholder except the
last one registered. Ruff B023 flagged it.

Fix: convert to ``@classmethod`` and read ``cls._process_definition`` so
each placeholder reads its own per-class attribute, which IS bound at
class-definition time (lines 167–168 in ``packages/core/src/dynastore/tasks/__init__.py``).
