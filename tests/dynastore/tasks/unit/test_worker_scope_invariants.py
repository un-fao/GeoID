"""Regression tests for the SCOPE → entry-point → meta-extras invariants.

Each Cloud Run Job (or in-process catalog task) is built with a
``<family>_task_<name>`` extras group from ``pyproject.toml`` — currently
``worker_task_*`` (separate Cloud Run Job images) and ``catalog_task_*``
(bundled into the catalog/worker images and dispatched in-process). If
build-config drifts from runtime expectations the container deploys
fine then crashes at first dispatch. This file pins three classes of
invariant that catch that drift at CI time.

1. **SCOPE-must-include-module_catalog** (B6 + Phase H):
   per-worker assertions that each catalog-touching task's SCOPE pulls
   in the modules its imports / Protocol calls need. Five entries today
   (elasticsearch_indexer, tiles_preseed, gdal, dimensions_materialize,
   dwh_join), each with a short comment naming the file:line that would
   crash without ``module_catalog``.

2. **SCOPE ↔ entry-point mapping** (PR #142):
   every ``worker_task_<name>`` extras key must have a matching
   ``dynastore.tasks.<name>`` entry-point and that entry-point's
   ``module:Class`` target must resolve to a real file on disk.

3. **meta-extras consistency** (PR #142):
   ``worker_service`` (in-process worker composition) and ``scope_worker``
   (Cloud Run worker image SCOPE) must agree on which ``worker_task_*``
   they pull in — drift means the deployed image carries different task
   code than the local worker, so bugs reproduce in one and not the other.

The original audit incident (2026-04-29) was on
``worker_task_elasticsearch_indexer``: module discovery left
``protocol_resolvers={'Catalogs': None, ...}`` and BulkCatalog/Collection
ReindexTask crashed at first dispatch. PR #131 fixed the SCOPE; the
remaining four invariants in class 1 above are prophylactic for the same
failure shape on the other catalog-touching tasks.

    """B6 #506: any deployable SCOPE whose closure contains ``core`` must
    also contain at least one Indexer-providing extras key.

    Rationale: ``core`` is the marker for services that boot the full
    dispatcher (db_async + web + configs + storage + cache). Such a
    service will discover the ``index_propagation`` ``dynastore.tasks``
    entry-point at startup. If no Indexer driver class is in the import
    closure, the very first dispatch finds zero implementors of
    ``is_<tier>_indexer = True`` and dead-letters — exactly the regression
    class #491's claim predicate guards against at *runtime*. This test
    enforces the same property at *build* time so a mis-deployed SCOPE
    breaks CI, not production.

    Filter: SCOPEs whose closure contains BOTH ``core`` and ``tasks``.
    ``core`` marks a service that boots the full dispatcher; ``tasks``
    is the canonical extras key that pulls in ``module_tasks`` +
    ``extension_tasks`` — the actual task-dispatch surface. A service
    with ``core`` but no ``tasks`` (e.g. ``scope_tools``, which forwards
    ``index_propagation`` to the catalog service per its task routing)
    is a router, not a dispatcher, and is out of scope for this invariant.
    Likewise
    ``worker_task_*`` images intentionally drop ``core`` and use
    ``task_base`` instead — a dedicated job image only runs the one
    task its SCOPE pins.
