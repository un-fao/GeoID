"""get_asset_search_driver — routing-aware SEARCH with READ fallback.

The asset search path resolves ``AssetRoutingConfig.operations[SEARCH]``
first and falls back to ``operations[READ]`` when no SEARCH driver is
configured (the zero-config default). Mirrors the collection-tier SEARCH
fallback and the routing-aware lookup design in issue #989.
