"""Regression coverage for external_id extraction from GDAL/shapefile features.

Issue #488: when ``items_write_policy.external_id_field`` named a non-``id``
attribute (e.g. ``ADM2_PCODE``) the extracted ``external_id`` was empty in DB,
because ``_extract_value`` only fell back to ``properties`` when the path
literally contained ``id`` or ``asset_id``. GDAL features arrive as
``{"properties": {...}, "geometry": ...}`` so the lookup at the root layer
missed every user-defined field.

The ``external_id_field`` knob was folded into
:attr:`ItemsWritePolicy.derive` (a ComputedField of kind EXTERNAL_ID whose
``name`` is the source path). The sidecar still receives the policy on
``context["_items_write_policy"]``; this module covers the still-live
``_extract_value`` resolution. The separate require-external-id guard layer
was removed in #1164 (it never fired in production — the wire schema's
``required`` list was never populated on the policy); a missing/empty
external_id that is a declared required field is now rejected by the normal
required-field check plus NOT NULL columns.
