"""Guard test: ``ensure_task_storage_exists`` refuses non-global schemas.

The global ``tasks.tasks`` table is provisioned exactly once, at
``TasksModule.lifespan``, in ``get_task_schema()`` (default ``"tasks"``).
Every CRUD path pins that schema; the per-row ``schema_name`` column is the
tenant discriminator.

Previously, three task runners (``tiles_preseed``, ``tiles_export``,
``dimensions_materialize``) called ``ensure_task_storage_exists(conn,
<catalog_schema>)`` under a "cellular safety" comment. That created an
unread shadow table per catalog plus a reaper pg_cron job firing every minute
on that empty table — pure overhead, never read by any CRUD path.

The helper now hard-raises on any schema other than ``get_task_schema()`` so
the regression cannot return silently.
