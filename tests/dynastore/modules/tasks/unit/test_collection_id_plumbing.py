"""Contract tests for ``collection_id`` plumbing through ExecutionEngine + runners.

Locks the behaviour added alongside the per-tenant tasks-table cleanup:

- ``RunnerContext.collection_id`` is a first-class field and defaults to None.
- ``ExecutionEngine.execute(..., collection_id=...)`` forwards into
  ``RunnerContext.collection_id``.
- The 3 in-runner ``TaskCreate(...)`` sites (``SyncRunner``,
  ``BackgroundRunner``, ``WorkerQueueRunner``) persist ``collection_id`` from
  the context onto the task row — closing the gap where OGC-Process-routed
  work resolved ``/collections/{collection_id}`` and lost it before INSERT.

These run pure-unit (no DB) by mocking ``create_task``.
