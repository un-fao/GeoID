"""Regression tests — FIX 1: _fetch_raw_rows resolves DB engine driver-agnostically.

When ``db_resource`` is None (Cloud Run JOB/worker context), the function must
NOT fall back to a bare ``ItemService().engine`` (which is None in that context).
Instead it must resolve an engine via the DatabaseProtocol registered in the
process (the same engine-discovery path all other worker code uses).

Contracts verified:
  - When db_resource is None AND DatabaseProtocol is registered, _fetch_raw_rows
    calls managed_transaction with the protocol engine (not ItemService().engine).
  - When db_resource is None AND DatabaseProtocol is absent (bare import context),
    _fetch_raw_rows returns {} rather than raising ValueError.
  - read_canonical_index_inputs returns a populated dict when db_resource is None
    but a DatabaseProtocol engine is present.
