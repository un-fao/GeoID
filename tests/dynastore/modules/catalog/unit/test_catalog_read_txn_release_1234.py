"""Regression guard for #1234 — catalog.catalogs read transaction must be
released before the router metadata fan-out runs.

Incident (#1233/#1234): a backend sat ``idle in transaction`` holding an
``AccessShareLock`` on ``catalog.catalogs`` (from ``SELECT * FROM
catalog.catalogs WHERE id = $1``) with ``wait_event = ClientRead`` — the
catalog read transaction was held open across the router metadata fan-out
(``_resolve_catalog_router_metadata`` -> ``get_catalog_metadata``), which
reaches network-capable domain drivers (e.g. Elasticsearch).  While that
fan-out awaited non-DB I/O, the Postgres backend idled in transaction and
its ``AccessShareLock`` convoyed a DDL ``AccessExclusive`` waiter, freezing
the platform.

The fix: read the catalog row inside the transaction, release it, and only
then run the router fan-out — on its own connection (``db_resource`` is no
longer the read connection).  These tests pin both halves of that invariant
for every ``catalog.catalogs`` reader:

* the router fan-out happens strictly AFTER the read transaction has exited;
* the fan-out is not handed the read connection (``db_resource`` is not the
  in-transaction connection), so it never extends the lock hold across I/O.
