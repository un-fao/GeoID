"""Regression: the storage write fan-out must NOT call ``write_entities`` on
item-indexer drivers (#1289).

An item-indexer driver (``is_item_indexer = True`` — the public/private ES
drivers) is pinned in ``operations[WRITE]`` with ``secondary_index=True`` and
is propagated by the *index dispatcher* (``_dispatch_index_upsert`` →
``index_bulk``), which stamps the canonical identity fields
(``_external_id`` / ``_asset_id``) onto the index payload.

Before this fix the same driver was ALSO fanned out as a secondary *storage*
driver via ``_fan_out_to_secondary_drivers`` → ``write_entities``. That second
write rebuilds the tenant doc from the read-back Feature, which carries
neither ``_external_id`` nor ``_asset_id`` (the fan-out call sites pass no
``context``), so it produces an identity-less doc. The two writes target the
same index/_id and race (the async secondary write is fire-and-forget), so a
last-writer-wins ordering could silently drop the identity fields. Indexer
drivers are owned by the dispatcher; the storage fan-out must skip them.
