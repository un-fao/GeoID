"""Contract pin for the liveness-reconciler PluginConfig fields on
``GcpModuleConfig`` — #735 plan step 12, deferred to #741.

#735 wired four runtime-tunable settings (Cloud Run spawn lease and the
reconciler's cadence / extension / grace windows) onto ``GcpModuleConfig`` as
``Mutable[...]`` fields so they can be reconfigured through the standard
PluginConfig surface without a redeploy. The plan's TDD step 12 ("PluginConfig
fields present + Mutable-marked; GcpJobRunner / reconciler read them") was not
landed with the original PR. This file closes that gap.

A regression here means either a field was renamed/removed (the runner /
reconciler will stop honouring operator overrides at runtime) or its
mutability marker was flipped (every config write would be rejected by the
immutability enforcer). Either is operationally invisible until the next time
an operator tries to tune the values — by which point ingestion is misbehaving.
