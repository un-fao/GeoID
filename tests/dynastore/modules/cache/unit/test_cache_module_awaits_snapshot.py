"""CacheModule awaits the engine snapshot refresh task — #833.

DBConfigModule (priority 0) populates ``app_state.engine_cache`` by handing
the same dict to ``asyncio.create_task(refresh_snapshot_until_ready(...))``
and yielding from its lifespan immediately.  CacheModule (priority 9) then
ran ``engine_cache.get("valkey_engine")`` *before* the task had a chance to
fill the dict, raising KeyError and silently latching the legacy
``VALKEY_URL`` / ``VALKEY_CLUSTER`` env fallback path with whatever topology
the deployment env happened to declare.

The fix publishes the task handle on ``app_state.engine_snapshot_refresh_task``
and CacheModule awaits it before any engine_cache read.  This file pins
that contract.
