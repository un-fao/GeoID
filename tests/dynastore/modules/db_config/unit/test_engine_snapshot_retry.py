"""Unit cover for the engine snapshot boot-order recovery (#818).

``DBConfigModule.lifespan`` runs at priority 0 — before ``DBService``
(priority 10) installs the connection pool — so the very first
``build_engine_snapshot`` call is guaranteed to fail with ``db_resource
is None``.  Without recovery the resolver would return KeyError forever
on this process and the ValkeyEngineConfig apply handler (gated on
engine_mode) would never register, silently breaking the runtime-tunable
contract advertised by #633 / #724 / #743.

The fix has two halves; this file pins the resolver half:

  1. ``build_engine_snapshot`` accepts an ``into=`` dict and mutates it
     in place, so a long-lived resolver closure observes successful
     entries from a later retry.
  2. ``refresh_snapshot_until_ready`` retries with exponential backoff
     until at least one engine loads or the budget is exhausted.

The cache-module half (unconditional apply-handler registration) is
covered alongside the existing reconnect suite in
``tests/dynastore/modules/cache/unit/test_valkey_reconnect.py``.
