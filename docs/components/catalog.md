# The Catalog Module

> **See also:** [`docs/architecture/collection-lifecycle.md`](../architecture/collection-lifecycle.md) — pending → active transitions, the three-call `POST /collections` → (optional) `PUT /configs/...` → `POST /items` workflow, and OGC compliance notes for lazy activation.

The `catalog` module serves as the authoritative source of truth for all metadata related to data organization within Agro-Informatics Platform (AIP) - Catalog Services. It is the system's "librarian", responsible for knowing what data exists, how it is grouped, and whether it is configured for physical storage.

## Responsibilities and Ownership
- **Ownership:** The `catalog` module has exclusive ownership of the `catalogs` and `collections` database tables. No other component is permitted to perform DDL or DML operations on these tables.
- **Lifecycle Management:** It manages the complete lifecycle of catalogs and collections, from creation to deletion (both soft and hard).
- **Information Hub:** It provides a centralized, cached, and performant API for all other components to query this organizational metadata.

## Core Functions and API
The public API of the `catalog` module is a set of clean, asynchronous Python functions that abstract away the underlying database queries:
- `create_catalog(conn, definition)`: Creates a new database schema and inserts a corresponding record into the `catalogs` table.
- `get_catalog` / `list_catalogs`: Cached, read-only functions for retrieving catalog metadata.
- `create_collection(conn, catalog_id, definition)`: The most critical function. It inserts a metadata record into the `collections` table. If the definition object contains a `layer_config`, this function orchestrates a call to `shared_queries.create_layer` to build the physical data table.
- `get_collection` / `list_collections`: Cached functions for retrieving collection metadata.
- `get_collection_layer_definition`: A specialized, cached function that retrieves only the `layer_config` JSONB object for a given collection. Highly performant method for services to check storage blueprints.

## The LayerConfig and "Physical" vs. "Logical" Collections
A fundamental concept in Agro-Informatics Platform (AIP) - Catalog Services's design is the distinction between a "logical" and a "physical" collection. The sole determinant of a collection's type is the presence or absence of the `layer_config` attribute.

### Logical Collections
- **Definition:** A collection created without a `layer_config`. Its entry in the `collections` table has `NULL` in the `layer_config` column.
- **Purpose:** To serve as a metadata grouping mechanism. Used to organize datasets, link to external resources, or build conceptual hierarchies, even if data is not stored.
- **Behavior:** Discoverable via APIs, but cannot be used as targets for data ingestion (`POST /items` will fail).

### Physical Collections
- **Definition:** A collection created with a valid `LayerConfig` object defining physical parameters (SRID, indexing, versioning behavior).
- **Purpose:** To store, manage, and serve geospatial feature data. Sits on top of real PostgreSQL tables.
- **Behavior:** Physical collections expose the full suite of CRUD functionality. Valid targets for bulk ingestion or feature manipulation.

## Item Deletion Semantics

Item deletion is a **soft delete**: the hub row's `deleted_at` column is set to `NOW()` rather than the row being physically removed. All read queries filter `WHERE h.deleted_at IS NULL`, making the item immediately invisible without destroying history.

### Delete-by-external-id (default)

When a collection has the `FeatureAttributeSidecar` enabled (the default), `DELETE /items/{item_id}` resolves `item_id` as an **external id**. The implementation joins the hub with the sidecar table and soft-deletes **all** active hub rows that share that external id:

```sql
UPDATE "<schema>"."<table>" h
SET    deleted_at = NOW()
FROM   "<schema>"."<table>_attributes" s
WHERE  s.external_id = :ext_id
  AND  h.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND  h.geoid = s.geoid
```

This is important when a collection uses `ALWAYS_ADD_NEW` versioning: a `PUT /items/{id}` inserts a new hub row instead of updating the existing one. Without deleting by external id, a subsequent `DELETE` would only remove the newest version, leaving older versions visible.

### Fallback: delete-by-geoid

If no sidecar exposes a `feature_id_field_name` (e.g. the sidecar has `enable_external_id = False`), the implementation falls back to a direct geoid match:

```sql
UPDATE "<schema>"."<table>"
SET    deleted_at = NOW()
WHERE  geoid = :geoid AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

In this mode `item_id` must be the raw geoid of the hub row.

## Item ID Resolution (`feature_id_expr`)

The `QueryOptimizer` exposes each item's public `id` via the expression:

```sql
COALESCE(<sidecar>.external_id, h.geoid::text) AS id
```

- When `external_id` is set (item was created with a client-supplied `id`), the external id is returned.
- When `external_id` is `NULL` (item was created without an explicit `id`), the system falls back to the hub's `geoid`, ensuring every item always has a stable, non-null public identifier.

The same expression is used in the `WHERE` clause of `GET /items/{item_id}`, so a `GET` by either the external id or the geoid always finds the correct item.
