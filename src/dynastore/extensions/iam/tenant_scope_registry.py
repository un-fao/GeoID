"""Declarative tenant-scope routing rules consumed by ``TenantScopeMiddleware``.

The middleware walks this registry on every request to decide whether a URL
needs per-catalog authorization. Routes themselves carry no authz wiring;
operators (or extension authors) add patterns here.

Each ``TenantScopeRule`` declares:
  - ``pattern``            — compiled regex matched against ``request.url.path``;
  - ``catalog_source``     — where to extract the catalog id from. Supported:
                              * ``"query:NAME"``       (?NAME=… query param)
                              * ``"header:NAME"``      (HTTP header)
                              * ``"regex_group:NAME"`` (named capture group on
                                ``pattern`` — required for path-based extraction
                                because ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` runs BEFORE
                                FastAPI route matching, so ``request.path_params``
                                is empty);
  - ``collection_source``  — optional, same source kinds. When set, the
                              middleware also pins ``collection_id`` to
                              ``request.state.tenant_scope`` for downstream
                              data-layer Protocols. Gating decisions remain
                              catalog-only;
  - ``default``            — value used when ``catalog_source`` resolves empty
                              (``"_system_"`` keeps platform-scope read
                              sysadmin-only);
  - ``allow_anonymous``    — when False, anonymous callers are 401'd before
                              dispatch.

Project-wide convention (per the path-based reshape): all per-catalog data
endpoints live at ``/{service}/catalogs/{catalog_id}[/collections/{collection_id}]/...``.
