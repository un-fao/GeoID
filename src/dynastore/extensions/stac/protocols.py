"""STAC capability sub-Protocols — owned by the STAC extension.

Two ``@runtime_checkable`` Protocols extend the core
``CollectionMetadataStore`` / ``CatalogMetadataStore`` surfaces to mark a
driver as STAC-slice-capable. STAC code dispatches via
``isinstance(d, StacCollectionMetadataCapability)`` instead of inspecting
a string ``domain`` ClassVar — class identity, not data identity.

Drivers structurally satisfy these by implementing the base Protocols and
living in ``modules/stac/`` (the practical "this driver persists STAC
fields" gate). A future tighter contract (e.g. a ``materialise_stac_extent()``
method) can be added here without touching core protocols.

    The PG-tier composition wrapper ``CollectionPostgresqlDriver``
    satisfies this structurally by exposing ``stac_metadata_columns()``
    that delegates to its first STAC-capable inner sidecar (or returns
    ``()`` if no STAC sidecar is loaded — e.g. a deployment without the
    stac extra).  ``stac_service._has_stac`` requires both the
    ``isinstance`` check AND a non-empty column tuple, so the empty
    delegation correctly identifies STAC as unavailable in those
    deployments.  Non-STAC drivers like ``CollectionElasticsearchDriver``
    lack the marker method entirely and fail the ``isinstance`` check
