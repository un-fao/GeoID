"""
Catalog-tier metadata router.

Parallels :mod:`dynastore.modules.catalog.collection_metadata_router`
but scoped to :class:`CatalogMetadataStore` implementations.
Three operations:

- :func:`get_catalog_metadata`      — fan-out READ that merges CORE +
  STAC envelopes into a single dict; later domains slot in here
  without changes at the call site.
- :func:`upsert_catalog_metadata`   — fan-out WRITE that hands the same
  payload to every configured driver (each driver ``_filter_payload``s
  down to its own domain's columns).
- :func:`delete_catalog_metadata`   — fan-out DELETE.

Resolution policy
-----------------

Resolves drivers by scanning every registered
:class:`CatalogMetadataStore` via ``get_protocols()``.  This discovery-
only path is deliberate for the WRITE / READ / DELETE operations
exposed here: the M2.3a backfill assumes both CORE and STAC tables
are always populated for catalogs that need them, and fan-out across
every discovered driver satisfies that assumption regardless of
per-catalog routing config.  Callers that need a filtered subset
(e.g. dry-run tooling) inject ``drivers=`` explicitly.

Per-catalog routing-config overrides live on a different code path:
:func:`dynastore.modules.catalog.reindex_worker._resolve_catalog_indexers`
queries ``CatalogRoutingConfig`` through the ``ConfigsProtocol`` 4-tier
waterfall for INDEX entries.  The WRITE / READ / DELETE router
deliberately does NOT honour per-catalog overrides — routing-config
overrides of the canonical Primary store would split writes across
drivers with inconsistent schemas, which is explicitly not supported.

Failure policy
--------------

Driver-level failures bubble up on WRITE / DELETE (data correctness
trumps availability).  On READ, a single domain's missing envelope is
treated as "this catalog has no data in that domain" — the merged dict
simply skips the absent keys.  A domain driver that raises on READ is
logged at WARNING and omitted from the merge; the caller sees a
partial envelope rather than a 5xx.  This matches the pre-refactor
behaviour where a legacy catalog with NULL STAC columns produced an
envelope missing those keys.

Transaction-scope contract (load-bearing)
-----------------------------------------

When a caller passes ``db_resource`` (an already-acquired live
``AsyncConnection``), **every** driver call in this module and every
downstream event emission must observe that same connection — no
driver may silently acquire a fresh pooled connection.  Correctness
hinges on the router's write + ``catalog_metadata_changed`` event
write landing inside the caller's transaction so the transactional-
outbox guarantee holds: if the outer transaction rolls back, the
events disappear with it.

The re-entrancy that makes this work lives in
:func:`dynastore.modules.db_config.query_executor.managed_transaction`:
when handed a live connection already ``in_transaction()``, it opens a
``SAVEPOINT`` via ``begin_nested()`` instead of a new ``BEGIN``.  The
per-domain Primary drivers follow the canonical pattern
``engine = db_resource or _get_engine()`` → ``managed_transaction(engine)``;
passing the caller's connection as ``engine`` takes the SAVEPOINT
branch.  Regressing any of those two invariants — drivers resolving
``_get_engine()`` when they shouldn't, or ``managed_transaction``
losing re-entrancy — silently detaches router writes from the caller's
transaction and breaks the outbox contract.  The router tests pin the
connection-identity propagation
(see ``test_catalog_metadata_router.py`` —
``test_upsert_fan_out_shares_db_resource`` and siblings) as the
fuse against that regression.

    pre-partition by domain.

    Sequential execution (not ``asyncio.gather``) to keep the driver

    ``catalog_metadata_changed`` event per driver-domain touched.  The
    event is the single signal INDEX / BACKUP consumers
    (``ReindexWorker`` + future export endpoint) listen for to pick
    up mutations on the canonical store.  Emission shares the caller's
    ``db_resource`` so the event write lives in the same transaction
    as the metadata write — transactional-outbox semantics: if the
    enclosing transaction rolls back, the event disappears with it,
    and no consumer wastes work on a never-committed mutation.

    Best-effort: an emission failure is logged but does NOT roll back
    the successful driver writes (the authoritative store already
    has the update; a missing event just means slower propagation
    until the consumer's backfill catches up).
