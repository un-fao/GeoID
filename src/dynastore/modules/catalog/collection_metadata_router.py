"""
Collection-tier metadata router — fan-out across registered drivers.

Mirror of :mod:`catalog_metadata_router` at the collection tier.  Every
registered :class:`CollectionMetadataStore` driver receives WRITE / DELETE
fan-outs and contributes its slice on READ; the router merges per-domain
dicts into the envelope returned to callers.  Default deployment
registers :class:`CollectionCorePostgresqlDriver` +
:class:`CollectionStacPostgresqlDriver`; additional drivers (ES indexer,
future TRANSFORM contributors) slot in without changing call sites.

Each driver's ``upsert_metadata`` filters the incoming payload to its
own domain's columns and no-ops when the filtered slice is empty —
caller passes the full envelope once; domain splitting happens inside
the driver.  Same pattern as the catalog-tier router.
