"""
Entity-transform chain runtime.

Walks the ordered chain of :class:`EntityTransformProtocol` implementers
resolved from ``operations[TRANSFORM]`` of the active routing config and
applies them to an entity at index time, or applies their inverses at
read time.

Empty chain ⇒ identity (no-op). The default behavior when no transformer
is registered for an entity is to leave the entity unchanged.

Composition contract:
- ``apply_transform_chain`` walks left-to-right. Transformer ``i+1``
  receives the output of transformer ``i`` as input.
- ``restore_transform_chain`` walks right-to-left so the output shape
  matches the original entity (inverses applied in reverse order).
