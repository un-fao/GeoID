"""
Routing plugin configuration — operation-based driver composition.

Maps **operations** (WRITE, READ, SEARCH) to an ordered list of drivers,
each with optional hints and a failure policy.

Key concepts:

- **Operations** = what the caller wants (WRITE, READ, SEARCH) — defined here
- **Capabilities** = how the driver performs it (SYNC, ASYNC, etc.) — in driver_config.py
- **Hints** = caller-provided preferences to select a specific driver within an operation
- **Failure policy** = per-driver behaviour on error: fatal, warn, or ignore

Resolution semantics:

- **WRITE** (no hint): execute ALL drivers in list (fan-out), respecting ``on_failure``
- **WRITE** (with hint): filter to matching drivers, execute those
- **READ/SEARCH** (no hint): return first driver in list (primary by position)
- **READ/SEARCH** (with hint): filter to matching, return first match

# (single SSOT) and apply the resolution semantics documented at the top

#   - SEARCH:    single-driver. Default = first; driver_hint overrides.
#   - TRANSFORM: ordered chain. Composition runtime in
#                modules/storage/transform_runtime.py applies it.

# asset}. Each entity reads from a different config:
#
#   item       → CollectionRoutingConfig.operations
#   collection → CollectionRoutingConfig.metadata.operations
#   catalog    → CatalogRoutingConfig.operations
#   asset      → AssetRoutingConfig.operations
