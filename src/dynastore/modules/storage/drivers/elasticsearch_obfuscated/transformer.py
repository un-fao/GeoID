"""
ObfuscatedEntityTransformer — first implementer of EntityTransformProtocol.

Reshapes a STAC item into the tenant-feature shape on the way to the
obfuscated index, and reverses the projection on the way back out for
clients. Pairs with :class:`ItemsElasticsearchObfuscatedDriver` (the
indexer + searcher) but is registered separately so the same
transformation can be reused with a different storage backend in the
future (e.g. BigQuery) without driver-class proliferation.

Discovery: implements :class:`EntityTransformProtocol`. Active when
``ObfuscatedEntityTransformer`` is listed in
``operations[TRANSFORM]`` of the relevant routing config. The
auto-augment helper ``_self_register_transformers_into`` will also
register it automatically when the package is loaded.

    On INDEX: builds a tenant-feature doc via
    :func:`build_tenant_feature_doc` and then applies
    :func:`simplify_to_fit` to keep the doc within ES's per-document size
    limit. The resulting ``simplification_factor`` and
    ``simplification_mode`` are persisted on the doc so clients can
    detect when geometry fidelity was reduced.

    On READ (restore): lifts the per-tenant flat fields back into a
    standard Feature shape — geometry, bbox, properties (with
    ``external_id`` and simplification metadata surfaced into
    properties) — matching what the regular STAC item readers expect.

    Currently delegates to platform helpers
    (``modules.elasticsearch.mappings.build_tenant_feature_doc`` and
    ``tools.geometry_simplify.simplify_to_fit``); both will move into
    this subpackage in the remainder of PR-2 of
