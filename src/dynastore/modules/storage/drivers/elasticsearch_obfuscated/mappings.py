"""
Elasticsearch index mapping + naming for the obfuscated items driver.

Driver-private — not imported by the platform :mod:`modules.elasticsearch.mappings`,
which holds only platform-wide STAC mappings (catalog/collection/item/asset).

Stores the full feature (geometry + properties + external_id) in a single
index per tenant (catalog). Access is gated by the DENY policy applied
when the obfuscated driver is active. Docs that would exceed the ES 10MB
per-doc limit are shrunk by ``simplify_to_fit``
(:mod:`dynastore.tools.geometry_simplify`), which records a
``simplification_factor`` and ``simplification_mode`` on the stored doc.
