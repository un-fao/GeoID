"""
Obfuscated Elasticsearch storage driver subpackage — self-contained.

Exports the driver class plus its companion entity-transformer. The
driver and the transformer are SEPARATE classes registered separately
in routing-config so the transformer can be reused with non-ES indexers
in the future.

Disabling the obfuscation feature in a deployment = removing the
``[obfuscated]`` extras group from SCOPE; nothing in the platform layer
needs to change.
