"""
Sidecar-resolution helper for the PG driver — ``_effective_sidecars``.

This module lives in the PG sidecars subpackage so it's colocated with
the configs it resolves, and so ``storage/drivers/postgresql.py``,
``modules/catalog/item_service.py``, and their test fixtures can all
import it without reaching into another module's internals.

Role in the role-based driver refactor (plan §M1b):

- M1b.1 retyped ``CollectionPostgresqlDriverConfig.sidecars`` as a
  discriminated union and kept an eager ``[geometries, attributes]``
  default for backwards-compat.
- M1b.2 (this module) supplies the **lazy** resolution path the driver
  now uses at DDL / read / write time: core PG defaults + registry
  injections get assembled here, on demand, based on actual collection
  context — so the field's ``default_factory`` can finally flip to
  empty (see ``driver_config.py``).  A default-body
  ``POST /collections/{id}`` now persists **zero** sidecar rows; the
  first DDL or write call resolves defaults here.
- M1b.3 uses this helper from the PG driver's new ``init_collection``
  hook when a caller explicitly supplies PG-specific ``layer_config``.

The caller-supplied ``col_config`` is typed as ``Any`` to avoid a
circular import with ``storage.driver_config`` (which imports the
concrete sidecar configs from this package).  The helper only reads
``.sidecars`` and ``.collection_type`` — duck typing is sufficient.

def _effective_sidecars(
    col_config: Optional[Any],
    *,
    catalog_id: str,
    collection_id: str = "",
    context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> List[Any]:
    """Resolve the effective sidecar list for a PG-backed collection.

    Layering (in order):

    1. **Explicit caller config** — if ``col_config.sidecars`` is non-empty,
       use it as-is.  Caller opted in to a specific PG layout.

    2. **Registry injections** — ``SidecarRegistry.get_injected_sidecar_configs``
       is the source of truth for collection_type-specific defaults
       (``VECTOR`` → ``[geometries, attributes]``, ``RECORDS`` →
       ``[attributes]``) and extension-contributed sidecars (e.g.
       ``item_metadata`` from STAC).  Entries whose ``sidecar_type`` is
       already present from step 1 are **not** duplicated; missing
       types are appended in registry-declaration order.

       So an empty ``col_config.sidecars`` with ``collection_type=VECTOR``
       still yields ``[geometries, attributes, ...]`` at use time — same
       effective behaviour as the pre-M1b.2 eager ``_default_sidecars()``
       default, but without persisting those defaults into
       ``collection_configs`` (plan §Principle — default-fast).

    Args:
        col_config: A ``CollectionPostgresqlDriverConfig`` (or ``None``
            when the driver couldn't load one — fallback path).  Only
            ``.sidecars`` and ``.collection_type`` are read; typed as
            ``Any`` to avoid a circular import with
            ``storage.driver_config``.
        catalog_id: Passed into the registry injection context so
            extension-scoped injections can respect per-catalog policy.
        collection_id: Same role as ``catalog_id``.  Defaults to ``""``
            for call sites with no specific collection in scope (e.g.
            catalog-wide introspection).
        context: Caller-supplied injection context dict.  Merged with
            the derived defaults (``catalog_id``, ``collection_id``,
            ``collection_type``) before the registry call.

    Returns:
        Ordered list of concrete ``SidecarConfig`` subclass instances
        (``GeometriesSidecarConfig``, ``FeatureAttributeSidecarConfig``,
        ``ItemMetadataSidecarConfig``, …).  Never ``None``.
