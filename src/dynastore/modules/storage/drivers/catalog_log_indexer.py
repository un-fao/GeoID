"""
LogCatalogIndexer — M3.2 of the role-based driver refactor.

First concrete INDEX-role driver for the catalog tier.  Does NOT
mirror metadata into a separate search store; instead it emits a
structured log line for every dispatch so operators can verify the
``catalog_metadata_changed`` → :class:`ReindexWorker` → INDEX-driver
pipeline end-to-end without standing up an Elasticsearch cluster.

Intended uses
-------------

* **Pipeline smoke-test**: pin the indexer under ``INDEX`` in a
  staging / dev override of :class:`CatalogRoutingConfig` and make a
  few catalog edits — the log lines prove events flowed all the way
  through.
* **Incident diagnostics**: flip the log level on this module to
  ``DEBUG`` in production to trace which catalogs are being touched
  and by which operation, without adding an ES dependency.
* **Reference implementation**: ~180 lines of the
  :class:`CatalogMetadataStore` protocol concretely satisfied.
  Subsequent real indexers (ES, vector-DB, external search service)
  can copy this shape and swap the log calls for backend I/O.

What this driver does NOT do
----------------------------

* ``get_catalog_metadata`` returns ``None`` always — a log indexer
  has no retrievable state.  If a caller reads the router merge
  with this as the only driver, they get ``None`` back (same as
  "no metadata stored").  In a realistic deployment the log
  indexer is ALWAYS paired with a real storing driver (the CORE /
  STAC Postgres Primaries in the shipped defaults), so this is
  never the only READ source.
* ``is_available`` always returns ``True``.  Even a broken Python
  logging backend would not meaningfully fail "log the event".
* Soft-delete is indistinguishable from hard-delete beyond a
  boolean in the log line — no tombstone retention.

Protocol contract
-----------------

:class:`CatalogMetadataStore` methods:

* ``capabilities`` — empty frozenset; the indexer reads nothing,
  writes nothing persistently, and serves no queries.  A future
  richer indexer would declare ``WRITE`` + ``SEARCH_FULLTEXT`` +
  whatever else its backend supports.
* ``sla``         — ``None``.  Log calls are synchronous and fast
  enough that the per-dispatch timeout machinery
  (:mod:`reindex_worker`) has no work to do here.  Operators who
  want a timeout can override
  :attr:`CatalogRoutingConfig.operations` INDEX entry to pin an SLA.

Routing-config default
----------------------

NOT in the default :class:`CatalogRoutingConfig.operations[INDEX]`
list.  Adding it by default would turn every write into an INFO log
line — too noisy for production.  Operators opt in via a platform-
level config override::

    from dynastore.models.protocols.driver_roles import (
        OperationDriverEntry,
    )
    from dynastore.modules.storage.routing_config import (
        CatalogRoutingConfig, Operation,
    )

    override = CatalogRoutingConfig(
        operations={
            **CatalogRoutingConfig().operations,
            Operation.INDEX: [
                OperationDriverEntry(driver_id="LogCatalogIndexer"),
            ],
        },
    )
"""

    """Diagnostic INDEX-role driver that logs every dispatch.
