"""Local-disk asset processes.

Mirrors :mod:`dynastore.modules.gcp.asset_processes` for the local backend.
Currently exposes a single process:

* ``download`` — for assets whose ``owned_by == "local"`` and whose ``uri``
  is a ``file://`` path. Returns a redirect to the bearer-auth-protected
  ``GET /local-download/{catalog_id}/{asset_id}`` route registered by
  :class:`LocalUploadModule`.

Local bytes never leave the auth perimeter, so no signed-URL machinery is
needed (no HMAC, no key storage, no rotation, no clock-skew TTL).
Authentication is enforced by the ``auth`` extension's middleware on the
download route the same way it protects ``POST /local-upload/{ticket_id}``.
