    Loads a ``.env`` file co-located with a component's source file (module,
    extension, or task) **without overriding** environment variables that are
    already set.

    Convention: place a ``.env`` file in the same directory as the component's
    Python package (next to ``__init__.py`` or the main module file).  The
    framework discovers and loads it automatically before the component is
    instantiated, so any secrets or local-dev overrides declared there are
    available from the very first line of ``__init__``.

    Existing environment variables always take precedence (``override=False``),
    so production/CI values set via Docker or CI secrets are never clobbered.
