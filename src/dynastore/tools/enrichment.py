"""
Cross-driver enrichment utilities.

Two functions:
  get_enrichment_data  — materialize enrichment data from any driver with
                         ENRICHMENT capability into a join-ready dict.
  enrich_features      — streaming O(1) join of a feature iterator against
                         pre-materialized enrichment data.

Typical usage pattern (replaces hardwired BQ join logic):

    # 1. Resolve enrichment driver
    enrichment_driver = await resolve_datasource(cat, coll, hint="enrichment")

    # 2. Materialize enrichment data (cached by caller when appropriate)
    enrichment = await get_enrichment_data(
        enrichment_driver, cat, coll,
        join_column="geoid",
        context={"query": bq_query, "project": "dwh-review"},
    )

    # 3. Optionally pre-filter feature query by join keys when set is small
    #    (existing QueryTransformProtocol pattern)

    # 4. Stream features from feature driver
    feature_driver = await resolve_datasource(cat, coll, hint="features")
    features = feature_driver.read_entities(cat, coll, request=query)

    # 5. Enrich (streaming, O(1) per feature)
    enriched = enrich_features(features, enrichment, join_column="geoid")

    """Materialize enrichment data from a driver into a join-ready dict.

    Reads all entities from ``driver.read_entities()`` and indexes them by
    ``join_column`` value.  The result is a plain ``dict`` suitable for
    O(1) per-feature lookup in ``enrich_features()``.

    Enrichment datasets are typically small (< 10 000 rows) so materializing
    them up-front avoids per-feature round-trips.  The caller is responsible
    for caching the result when appropriate.

    Args:
        driver: A ``CollectionStorageDriverProtocol`` with ENRICHMENT capability.
        catalog_id: The catalog that owns the collection.
        collection_id: The collection to read enrichment data from.
        join_column: Feature property key used as join key.
        context: Driver-specific context (e.g. BigQuery query, project ID).
        limit: Safety cap on rows materialized. Defaults to 10 000.

    Returns:
        ``{join_key: properties_dict}`` — ready for ``enrich_features()``.
