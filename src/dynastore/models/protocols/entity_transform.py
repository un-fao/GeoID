EntityTransformProtocol — drivers that mutate entities on the way to / from
storage.

A transformer is a driver whose role is to reshape an entity payload before
it lands in an indexer's storage, and to reverse that reshape on the way
back out for clients. Active transformers per entity are resolved from
``operations[TRANSFORM]`` in the relevant routing config (see
``modules/storage/routing_config.py``).

The protocol itself is the structural marker — discovery uses
``get_protocols(EntityTransformProtocol)``. There is no parallel capability
flag; implementing the protocol is the contract.

Composition: multiple transformers may be chained per entity. The chain
runs left-to-right at index time and right-to-left at read time. Empty
chain ⇒ identity (no-op).

    mutation of inputs in place. The chain runtime composes transformers,
