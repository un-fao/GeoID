"""
Collection Storage Driver Protocol — entity-level storage abstraction.

Drivers implement this protocol to provide read/write/delete operations
on collections using any backend (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, DuckDB,
Iceberg, Neo4j, Spanner, BigQuery, Redis, static files, etc.).

Design principles:
  - Entity-level, not SQL-level: drivers work with typed Pydantic models.
  - Streaming-first (O(1) memory): ``read_entities`` returns ``AsyncIterator``.
  - Query via ``QueryRequest``: structured, validated queries with typed
    filters, sorts, and field selections.
  - Any driver can be primary or secondary — the framework is driver-agnostic.
  - Capabilities: drivers declare what they support via ``FrozenSet[str]``
    using ``Capability`` string constants or any custom string.
  - Unified soft delete: ``delete_entities(soft=True)`` and
    ``drop_storage(soft=True)`` for recoverable operations.

Type contracts:
  - Write input: ``Feature | FeatureCollection | Dict[str, Any] | List[Dict]``
    (same union accepted by ``ItemCrudProtocol.upsert``).
  - Read output: ``AsyncIterator[Feature]`` — typed Pydantic models, not raw dicts.
  - Query input: ``QueryRequest`` — structured, not opaque dicts.
