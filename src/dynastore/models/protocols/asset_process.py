"""Parametric asset-process protocol.

A DynaStore *asset process* is any named operation that can be invoked on a
specific asset:

* ``download`` — generate a short-lived access URL
* ``ingest``   — trigger ingestion into a storage driver
* ``validate`` — run a format / schema check
* ``convert``  — produce a derived asset in a new format
* ``inspect``  — return metadata extracted from the blob

Processes are registered as ``AssetProcessProtocol`` implementations discovered
via ``get_protocols(AssetProcessProtocol)``. The asset REST layer mounts each
registered process symmetrically under::

    {GET|POST} /assets/catalogs/{cid}/assets/{aid}/{process_id}
    {GET|POST} /assets/catalogs/{cid}/collections/{colid}/assets/{aid}/{process_id}

This mirrors OGC API - Processes (`process_id` as path parameter) but scopes
the input to an existing Asset, which is always the first parameter of
``execute``.

Discovery
---------
``GET /assets/catalogs/{cid}/assets/{aid}/processes`` returns the list of
processes *applicable* to that asset (backends may opt out per-asset based on
``owned_by``, URI scheme, asset type, etc.).
