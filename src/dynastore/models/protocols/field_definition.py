"""
Driver-agnostic field definitions and feature type declarations.

``FieldDefinition`` and ``FieldCapability`` describe the queryable surface of a
collection — name, type, capabilities (filterable, sortable, etc.).  These are
protocol-level concepts used by all drivers and extensions.

``FeatureTypeDefinition`` acts as a decorator: it declares which fields are
exposed, added, or removed at a given entity level (catalog, collection, item,
asset).  Drivers use it to create storage with the right structure; extensions
use it to build OGC/STAC responses.
