``IamQueryProtocol`` — read-side IAM lookups for non-IAM consumers.

Routes, extensions, and middleware-adjacent code MUST NOT import
``dynastore.modules.iam.*`` directly. They consume identity from
``request.state.principal`` (populated by ``IamMiddleware``) and any
further IAM read operations through this Protocol.

The concrete implementation is registered by the IAM module via the
plugin discovery system; consumers resolve it with
``get_protocol(IamQueryProtocol)``.
