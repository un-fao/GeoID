"""
Asset storage driver protocol.

Drivers that manage asset-level storage (index, search, delete asset documents)
implement this protocol.  They differ from ``CollectionItemsStore``
which deals with geographic features — asset drivers deal with metadata about
files, services, or datasets attached to a collection.

A driver may implement both protocols if it handles both features and assets
(unlikely in practice; separate drivers are preferred).
