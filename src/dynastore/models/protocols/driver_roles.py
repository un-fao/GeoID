"""
Driver-role shared types — DriverSla.

Per-driver SLA wrapper used mainly on TRANSFORM / INDEX / BACKUP driver
entries.  Mandatory on TRANSFORM drivers so the hot path is never
unboundedly delayed; optional on INDEX / BACKUP to govern async
propagation timeouts.  Kept separate from ``WriteMode`` /
``FailurePolicy`` so it can be attached per-entry rather than per-class.

Per-driver "which slice of the payload" identification was previously
done via a ``MetadataDomain`` StrEnum + ``ClassVar`` ClassVar on each
driver.  That coupling was removed when STAC was promoted to its own
module — STAC drivers now satisfy ``StacCollectionMetadataCapability``
(a ``@runtime_checkable Protocol`` owned by ``extensions/stac/protocols.py``)
and consumers dispatch via ``isinstance``.

    """Per-driver SLA governing TRANSFORM / INDEX / BACKUP execution.

    Mandatory on TRANSFORM drivers — a transform without an SLA can quietly
    tax the hot path.  Optional on INDEX / BACKUP where it governs async
    propagation timeouts rather than user-facing latency.

    Attributes:
        timeout_ms: Hard timeout on a single invocation.  Default 500ms —
            keeps TRANSFORM round-trips bounded on read-through.
        on_timeout: Behaviour when the timeout fires.
            - ``fail``: raise; caller sees an error.
            - ``degrade``: return whatever's available so far; caller sees
              the untransformed envelope + ``X-Transform-Degraded`` header.
            - ``skip``: silently skip this driver and continue the chain.
        required: If True, a timeout / failure escalates to a 504 on
            user-facing read paths regardless of ``on_timeout``.  Use
            sparingly — breaks the "default-fast, transform-optional"
            invariant when true.
