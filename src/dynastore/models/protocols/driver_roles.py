"""
Driver-role shared types — MetadataDomain + DriverSla.

These types are shared across the role-based driver architecture
(Primary / Transformer / Indexer / Backup).

- :class:`MetadataDomain` — which slice of the payload a driver owns
  (``CORE``, ``STAC``, future ``RECORDS``/``DC``/``STATS``).  Declared as
  ``ClassVar[MetadataDomain]`` on concrete driver classes; the router reads it
  statically to group drivers by domain without instantiation.

- :class:`DriverSla` — per-driver SLA wrapper used mainly on TRANSFORM /
  INDEX / BACKUP driver entries.  Mandatory on TRANSFORM drivers so the hot
  path is never unboundedly delayed; optional on INDEX / BACKUP to govern
  async propagation timeouts.  Kept separate from ``WriteMode`` /
  ``FailurePolicy`` so it can be attached per-entry rather than per-class.

    ``CORE`` — title, description, keywords, license, extra_metadata.  Owned
    by the ``catalog`` module; always present.

    ``STAC`` — stac_version, stac_extensions, conforms_to, extent, providers,
    summaries, assets, item_assets, links.  Owned by the ``stac`` extension;
    DDL created only when STAC is loaded.

    Future extensions plug additional domains through the same routing surface.

    Mandatory on TRANSFORM drivers — a transform without an SLA can quietly

    propagation timeouts rather than user-facing latency.

    Attributes:
        timeout_ms: Hard timeout on a single invocation.  Default 500ms —
            keeps TRANSFORM round-trips bounded on read-through.
        on_timeout: Behaviour when the timeout fires.
            - ``fail``: raise; caller sees an error.
            - ``degrade``: return whatever's available so far; caller sees
              the untransformed envelope + ``X-Transform-Degraded`` header.
            - ``skip``: silently skip this driver and continue the chain.
        required: If True, a timeout / failure escalates to a 504 on
            user-facing read paths regardless of ``on_timeout``.  Use
