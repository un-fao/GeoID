Asset upload protocol definitions.

Overview
--------
``AssetUploadProtocol`` is a backend-agnostic interface for initiating and
polling asset uploads.  Implementations exist for every storage backend; the
client code and the REST API layer use only this contract and remain ignorant
of the underlying storage technology.

Upload flows
~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Event-driven backends (GCS, S3)**::

    from dynastore.modules.storage.router import get_asset_upload_driver
    from dynastore.modules.catalog.asset_service import AssetUploadDefinition, AssetTypeEnum

    # Routed lookup: respects AssetRoutingConfig.operations[UPLOAD] per
    # catalog/collection. Falls back to first-registered backend when no
    # UPLOAD entry resolves (matches the legacy get_protocol behaviour).
    upload = await get_asset_upload_driver(catalog_id="imagery_catalog")

    ticket = await upload.initiate_upload(
        catalog_id="imagery_catalog",
        asset_def=AssetUploadDefinition(
            asset_id="LC09_198030_20251225",
            asset_type=AssetTypeEnum.RASTER,
            metadata={"sensor": "OLI-2", "cloud_cover": 5.2},
        ),
        filename="LC09_L1TP_198030_20251225_02_T1.tif",
        content_type="image/tiff",
        collection_id="landsat_scenes",
    )
    # ticket.method  = "PUT"
    # ticket.upload_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/...?upload_id=..."
    # ticket.headers = {"Content-Type": "image/tiff"}
    # ticket.backend = "gcs"

    # Client PUTs the file directly to GCS (no server hop):
    #   PUT ticket.upload_url
    #   headers: ticket.headers
    #   body: <file bytes>

    # GCS fires OBJECT_FINALIZE → GcsStorageEventTask → create_asset(owned_by="gcs")

    # Poll until status == "completed":
    from dynastore.models.protocols import UploadStatus
    response = await upload.get_upload_status(
        ticket_id=ticket.ticket_id,
        catalog_id="imagery_catalog",
    )
    assert response.status == UploadStatus.COMPLETED
    print("Registered asset_id:", response.asset_id)

**Server-side backends (local disk)**::

    ticket = await upload.initiate_upload(
        catalog_id="field_data",
        asset_def=AssetUploadDefinition(
            asset_id="gadm_adm2_italy",
            asset_type=AssetTypeEnum.VECTORIAL,
            metadata={"source": "GADM", "version": "4.1"},
        ),
        filename="gadm_adm2_italy.geojson",
        content_type="application/geo+json",
    )
    # ticket.method     = "POST"
    # ticket.upload_url = "/local-upload/<ticket_id>"
    # ticket.backend    = "local"

    # Client POSTs the file to the local proxy endpoint.
    # The endpoint streams to staging, calls complete_upload() synchronously,
    # and the asset is registered immediately → status is already COMPLETED.

REST API equivalent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    # Catalog-level upload:
    POST /assets/catalogs/{catalog_id}/upload
    {
        "filename": "scene.tif",
        "content_type": "image/tiff",
        "asset": {"asset_id": "scene_001", "asset_type": "RASTER", "metadata": {}}
    }
    # → 200 UploadTicket

    # Collection-level upload:
    POST /assets/catalogs/{catalog_id}/collections/{collection_id}/upload

    # Poll status:
    GET /assets/catalogs/{catalog_id}/upload/{ticket_id}/status
    # → 200 UploadStatusResponse  (status: pending | uploading | completed | failed)

``complete_upload`` is intentionally **not** part of this protocol — it is
driver-internal and triggered differently per backend.  The client only needs
to initiate the session and optionally poll its status.
