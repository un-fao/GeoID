"""
Generalized, consumer-agnostic asset-link contribution protocol.

Producers (Maps, Tiles, Features, …) implement `AssetContributor` and
declare what asset links they can emit for a given resource reference.
Consumers (STAC, Records, Coverages, Features) iterate
`get_protocols(AssetContributor)` and attach the yielded `AssetLink`s
to their own representation, without importing each other.

This is distinct from `AssetEnricherProtocol` (which mutates a single
asset document at read time — e.g. resolves URIs, filters fields).
